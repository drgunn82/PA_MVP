1. Background:
Livmarli (maralixibat) is an ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor indicated for the treatment of
cholestatic pruritis in patients 12 months of age and older with progressive familial intrahepatic
cholestasis (PFIC). Livmarli is also indicated for the treatment of cholestatic pruritis in patients 3
months of age and older with Alagille syndrome (ALGS).
PFIC is a heterogeneous group of liver disorders of autosomal recessive inheritance, characterized
by an early onset of cholestasis (usually during infancy) with pruritus and malabsorption, which
rapidly progresses and ends up as liver failure. Pruritus is the most obvious and the most
unbearable symptom in cholestasis. It has been proposed that it is induced by the stimulation of
nonmyelinated subepidermal free nerve ends because of increased serum bile acids.
ALGS is a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the JAG1 or Notch2 genes which are
involved in embryonic development in utero. In ALGS patients, multiple organ systems may be
affected by the mutation. In the liver, the mutation causes the bile ducts to abnormally narrow,
malform and reduce in number, leading to bile acid accumulation, cholestasis, and ultimately
progressive liver disease. The cholestatic pruritus experienced by patients with ALGS is among
the most severe in any chronic liver disease and is present in most affected children by the third
year of life.
Conventional treatments for pruritis associated with PFIC or Alagille syndrome include
uroseoxycholic acid (UCDA), antihistamines (e,g., diphenhydramine), bile acid sequestrants (e.g.,
cholestyramine), rifampin, naltrexone and sertraline.
Limitation of Use:
Livmarli is not recommended in a subgroup of PFIC type 2 patients with specific ABCB11
variants resulting in non-functional or complete absence of bile salt export pump (BSEP) protein.
