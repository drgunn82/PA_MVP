1. Background:
Qelbree is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor indicated for the treatment of attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults and pediatric patients 6 years and older. The American
Academy of Pediatrics generally recommends stimulants as first-line medications for the treatment of
ADHD. Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (e.g. atomoxetine) and selective alpha-2
adrenergic agonists (e.g. clonidine extended-release, guanfacine extended-release) are also
recommended, however the data are less robust.
