P&T Approval Date 2/2022, 2/2023, 11/2023, 7/2024
Effective Date 10/1/2024
1. Background:
Lybalvi (olanzapine/samidorphan)* is FDA approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and for
the treatment of bipolar 1 disorder for acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes as monotherapy,
as an adjunct to lithium or valproate, and as maintenance monotherapy.
For the treatment of schizophrenia, the selection of which antipsychotic medication to use for an
individual patient with schizophrenia should be made based on patient clinical factors and the side
effect profiles of antipsychotic drugs. With the exception of clozapine for patients with refractory
symptoms, there is not convincing evidence to favor one antipsychotic over the others based on
efficacy.
For the treatment of bipolar disorder acute manic or mixed episodes, treatment selection depends on
the severity of illness and associated features, and patient preference. Second-generation (atypical)
antipsychotics are generally preferred over first-generation (typical) antipsychotics because of their
favorable side effect profile. No one antipsychotic is preferred over the others.
