1. Background:
The coverage criteria below provides parameters for coverage of specific oral oncology
medications covered under the pharmacy benefit based upon the National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) Drugs & Biologics Compendium™. The Compendium lists the
appropriate drugs and biologics for specific cancers using U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved disease indications and specific NCCN panel recommendations. Each
recommendation is supported by a level of evidence category.
UnitedHealthcare recognizes indications and uses of oral oncology medications listed in the
NCCN Drugs and Biologics Compendium with Categories of Evidence and Consensus of 1,
2A, and 2B as proven and Categories of Evidence and Consensus of 3 as unproven.
UnitedHealthcare will cover all chemotherapy agents for individuals under the age of 19 years.
The majority of pediatric patients receive treatments on national pediatric protocols that are
similar in concept to the NCCN patient care guidelines.
Additional Information:
The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) are a
comprehensive set of guidelines detailing the sequential management decisions and
interventions that currently apply to more than 97 percent of cancers affecting patients in the
United States. In addition, separate guidelines provide recommendations for some of the key
cancer prevention and screening topics as well as supportive care considerations, and specific
populations. The guidelines are developed and updated by 60 individual panels, comprising
over 1,700 clinicians and oncology researchers from the 31 NCCN member institutions.
NCCN categories for recommendations are based on both the level of clinical evidence
available and the degree of consensus within the NCCN Guidelines panel. Evidence of both
efficacy and safety of interventions is considered by the panel.
The level of evidence for each recommendation depends upon the following factors:
• Quality of data based on trial design and how the results/observations were derived (e.g.,
randomized controlled trials [RCTs], non-RCTs, meta-analyses or systematic reviews,
clinical case reports, case series)
• Quantity of data (e.g., number of trials, size of trials, clinical observations only),
• Consistency of data (e.g., similar, or conflicting results across available studies or
observations)

NCCN Categories of Evidence and Consensus:
Category 1: The recommendation is based on high-level evidence (i.e., high-powered
randomized clinical trials or meta-analyses), and the panel has reached uniform NCCN
consensus (majority panel vote of at least 85%) that the intervention is appropriate.
Category 2A: The recommendation is based on lower-level evidence, but despite the absence
of higher-level studies, there is uniform NCCN consensus (majority panel vote of at least 85%)
that the intervention is appropriate.
Category 2B: The recommendation is based on lower-level evidence, and there is NCCN
consensus (majority panel vote of at least 50%, but less than 85%) that the intervention is
appropriate.
Category 3: Based on any level of evidence, regardless of the quality of evidence, there is
major NCCN disagreement that the intervention is appropriate (a panel vote of at least 25% to
include and designate a recommendation as Category 3 is required).
Coverage Information:
Members will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage. For members under the age
of 19 years, the prescription will automatically process without a coverage review.
Some states mandate benefit coverage for off-label use of medications for some diagnoses or
under some circumstances. Some states also mandate usage of other Compendium references.
Where such mandates apply, they supersede language in the benefit document or in the
notification criteria.
