1. Background:
Sprycel (dasatinib) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for newly diagnosed adults with
Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase.
Sprycel is also indicated for treatment of adults with chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid
blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including Gleevec®
(imatinib), for the treatment of adults with Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with
resistance or intolerance to prior therapy, for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and
older with Ph+ CML in chronic phase, and for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age
and older with Ph+ ALL in combination with chemotherapy. The National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends the use of Sprycel in the following: BCR-ABL1
positive CML, in gastrointestinal stromal tumor in patients with PDGFRA exon 18 mutations,
metastatic chondrosarcoma, in recurrent chordoma, in myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with
eosinophilia and ABL1 rearrangement, and in cutaneous melanoma with metastatic or
unresectable tumors with activating mutations of KIT as second-line or subsequent therapy for
disease progression, intolerance, and/or projected risk of progression with BRAF-targeted
therapy.
