infection without cirrhosis and with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). Mavyret is also
indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 3 years and older with HCV genotype
1 infection, who previously have been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A
inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both.1
