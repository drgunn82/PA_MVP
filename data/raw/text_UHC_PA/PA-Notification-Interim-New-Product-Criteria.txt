1. Background:
The purpose of this guideline is to establish a procedure by which to review requests for newly
FDA-approved drug products that require notification. This general criterion will apply only
until drug-specific criteria can be developed and implemented for claims processing. Once
drug-specific criteria are available, and the authorization provided from this general criterion
expires, the subsequent coverage review will be completed using the Initial Authorization
section of the drug-specific criteria. UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy (UHCP) will designate the
specific medications which are subject to this criterion and inform the Pharmacy Benefits
Administrator (PBA). Oral oncology products will use the Oral Chemotherapeutic Agent Prior
Authorization Program criteria for review.
2. Coverage Criteria:
A. Guideline
1. For recent FDA-approved drug products for which drug-specific criteria are unavailable,
the requested drug will be approved based on both of the following criteria:
a. Diagnosis is consistent with an indication listed in the product’s FDA-approved
prescribing information (or package insert)
b. Additional requirements listed in the “Indications and Usage” and “Dosage and
Administration” sections of the prescribing information (or package insert) have
been met (e.g. first line therapies have been tried and failed; any testing
requirements have been met, etc.)
Authorization will be issued for 6 months and should allow a quantity ceiling limit up
to the maximum FDA approved dose unless otherwise noted on tracking grid or unless
the FDA approved treatment duration is less than 6 months.
• If FDA approved treatment duration is less than 6 months utilize the approved
duration for authorization period.
• Requests for higher quantity beyond the FDA approved maximum dosing are not
separately reviewable by the PA department.

3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization
based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.
Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.
