Effective Date 9/1/2025
1. Background:
Tagrisso (osimertinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for first-line treatment of patients with
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R mutations, and patients with metastatic
EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC, whose disease has progressed on or after EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. Tagrisso is also indicated for adjuvant therapy after
tumor resection in adults with NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21
L858R mutations, and for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced, unresectable
(stage III) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed during or
following concurrent or sequential platinum-based chemoradiation therapy and whose tumors
have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 L858R
mutations. The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) recommends the use of
Tagrisso for the treatment for limited and extensive brain metastases in EGFR mutation-
positive NSCLC. NCCN also recommends Tagrisso for use in leptomeningeal metastases from
NSCLC that is EGFR mutation-positive.
