1. Background:
Lumryz, Xyrem (sodium oxybate) and Xywav are central nervous system depressants indicated for
the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. Xyway
is also indicated for idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) in adults.
Lumryz, Xyrem and Xywav are classified as a Schedule III controlled substance by Federal law. The
active ingredient, sodium oxybate or gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), is listed in the most restrictive
schedule of the Controlled Substances Act (Schedule I). Thus, non-medical uses are classified under
Schedule I.
Lumryz, Xyrem and Xywav are available only through a REMS program with restricted distribution.
The REMS Program provides educational materials to the prescriber and the patient explaining the
risks and proper use of Lumryz, Xyrem and Xywav, and the required prescription form. Once it is
documented that the patient has read and/or understood the materials, the drug will be shipped to the
patient. The REMS Program also recommends patient follow-up every 3 months. Physicians are
expected to report all serious adverse events to the manufacturer.
Members will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.
