Effective Date 6/1/2025
1. Background:
Evrysdi is a survival of motor neuron 2 (SMN2) splicing modifier indicated for the treatment of
spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in pediatric and adult patients.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization
1. Evrysdi will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Diagnosis of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)
-AND-
b. Submission of medical records (e.g., chart notes, laboratory values) confirming the
mutation or deletion of genes in chromosome 5q resulting in one of the following:
(1) Homozygous gene deletion or mutation of SMN1 gene (e.g., homozygous deletion
of exon 7 at locus 5q13)
-OR-
(2) Compound heterozygous mutation of SMN1 gene (e.g., deletion of SMN1 exon 7
[allele 1] and mutation of SMN1 [allele 2])
-AND-
c. Patient is not dependent on either of the following:
(1) Invasive ventilation
(2) Use of non-invasive ventilation beyond use for naps and nighttime sleep
-AND-
d. Patient is not receiving concomitant chronic survival motor neuron (SMN) modifying
therapy [e.g., Spinraza (nusinersen)]
-AND-
e. One of the following:

(1) Patient has not previously received gene replacement therapy for the treatment of
SMA [e.g., Zolgensma (onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi)]
-OR-
(2) Both of the following:
(a) Patient has previously received gene replacement therapy [e.g., Zolgensma
(onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi)] for the treatment of SMA
-AND-
(b) Submission of medical records (e.g., chart notes, laboratory values)
documenting a clinically meaningful functional decline (e.g., loss of motor
milestone) since receiving gene replacement therapy [e.g., Zolgensma
(onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi)]
-AND-
f. Submission of medical records (e.g., chart notes, laboratory values) documenting the
baseline assessment of at least one of the following exams (based on patient age and
motor ability) to establish baseline motor ability (baseline motor function analysis
could include assessments evaluated prior to receipt of previous chronic SMN
modifying therapy if transitioning therapy)*:
* Baseline assessments for patients less than 2 months of age requesting Evrysdi are not necessary
in order to not delay access to initial therapy in recently diagnosed infants. Initial assessments
shortly post-therapy can serve as baseline with respect to efficacy reauthorization assessment.
(1) Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP
INTEND)
(2) Hammersmith Infant Neurological Exam Part 2 (HINE-2)
(3) Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE)
(4) Revised Upper Limb Module (RULM) Test
(5) Motor Function Measure 32 (MFM-32) Scale
-AND-
g. Prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist with expertise in the treatment of
SMA
Authorization will be issued for 12 months.
B. Reauthorization
1. Evrysdi will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Submission of medical records (e.g., chart notes, laboratory values) with the most
recent results documenting a positive clinical response to Evrysdi compared to

pretreatment baseline status (inclusive of baseline assessments prior to receipt of
previous chronic SMN modifying therapy) as demonstrated by at least one of the
following exams:
(1) CHOP INTEND: One of the following:
(a) Improvement or maintenance of previous improvement of at least a 4 point
increase in score from pretreatment baseline
(b) Patient has achieved and maintained any new motor milestone from
pretreatment baseline when they would otherwise be unexpected to do so
-OR-
(2) HINE-2: One of the following:
(a) Improvement or maintenance of previous improvement of at least 2 point (or
maximal score) increase in ability to kick
(b) Improvement or maintenance of previous improvement of at least 1 point
increase in any other HINE-2 milestone (e.g., head control, rolling, sitting,
crawling, etc.), excluding voluntary grasp
(c) The patient exhibited improvement, or maintenance of previous improvement
in more HINE motor milestones than worsening, from pretreatment baseline
(net positive improvement)
(d) Patient has achieved and maintained any new motor milestones when they
would otherwise be unexpected to do so
-OR-
(3) HFMSE: One of the following:
(a) Improvement or maintenance of previous improvement of at least a 3 point
increase in score from pretreatment baseline
(b) Patient has achieved and maintained any new motor milestone from
pretreatment baseline when they would otherwise be unexpected to do so
-OR-
(4) RULM: One of the following:
(a) Improvement or maintenance of previous improvement of at least a 2 point
increase in score from pretreatment baseline
(b) Patient has achieved and maintained any new motor milestone from
pretreatment baseline when they would otherwise be unexpected to do so

(5) MFM-32: One of the following:
(a) Improvement or maintenance of previous improvement of at least a 3 point
increase in score from pretreatment baseline
(b) Patient has achieved and maintained any new motor milestone from
pretreatment baseline when they would otherwise be unexpected to do so
-AND-
b. Patient is not dependent on either of the following:
(1) Invasive ventilation
(2) Use of non-invasive ventilation beyond use for naps and nighttime sleep
-AND-
c. Patient is not receiving concomitant chronic survival motor neuron (SMN) modifying
therapy [e.g., Spinraza (nusinersen)]

Authorization will be issued for 12 months.
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific benefit
plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization management
programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization
based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.
Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.
• Supply limits may be in place.
