1. Background:
Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir) is a fixed-dose combination of glecaprevir, a hepatitis C
virus (HCV) NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and pibrentasvir, an HCV NS5A inhibitor, and is
indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 3 years and older with chronic HCV
genotype (GT) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis
(Child-Pugh A). Mavyret is also indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 3
years and older with HCV genotype 1 infection, who previously have been treated with a
regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both.1
