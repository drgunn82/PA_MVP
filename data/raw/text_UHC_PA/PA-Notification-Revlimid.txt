1. Background:
Revlimid® (lenalidomide) is a thalidomide analogue indicated for the treatment of adult patients
with the following: multiple myeloma (MM), in combination with dexamethasone; MM, as
maintenance following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT);
transfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS) associated with a deletion 5q abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic
abnormalities; mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) whose disease has relapsed or progressed after two
prior therapies, one of which included bortezomib; previously treated follicular lymphoma (FL),
in combination with a rituximab product; and previously treated marginal zone lymphoma
(MZL), in combination with a rituximab product.1
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends use of Revlimid for
treatment of the following B-Cell lymphomas: histologic transformation of indolent lymphomas
to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, nodal marginal zone lymphoma, classic
follicular lymphoma, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of nongastric sites (noncutaneous),
extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL) of the stomach, high-grade B-cell lymphoma,
splenic marginal zone lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, diffuse large B-
cell lymphoma, and HIV-related B-cell lymphomas. Additionally, NCCN recommends the use of
Revlimid for Kaposi Sarcoma, primary CNS lymphoma, castleman disease, chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), MDS/MPN overlap neoplasms,
myelofibrosis-associated anemia, systemic light chain amyloidosis, classic Hodgkin lymphoma,
Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Rosai-Dorfman disease, and the following T-cell lymphomas:
hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and adult T-cell
leukemia/lymphoma.
Because of the risk of serious malformations if given during pregnancy, there is an extensive risk
management program requiring registration by patients, prescribers and dispensing pharmacies.
