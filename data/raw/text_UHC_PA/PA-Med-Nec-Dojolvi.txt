1. Background:
Dojolvi (triheptanoin) is a medium-chain triglyceride indicated as a source of calories and fatty
acids for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with molecularly confirmed long-chain
fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD).
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization
1. Dojolvi will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Submission of medical records confirming the diagnosis of long-chain fatty acid
oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD) with at least two of the following diagnostic criteria:
(1) Disease specific elevation of acylcarnitines on a newborn blood spot or in
plasma
(2) Low enzyme activity in cultured fibroblasts
(3) Genetic testing demonstrating one or more pathogenic mutations in a gene
associated with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (e.g., CPT2,
ACADVL, HADHA, or HADHB)
-AND-
b. Patient is not receiving Dojolvi in combination with any other medium-chain
triglyceride (MCT) products
-AND-
c. Prescribed by a board-certified medical geneticist experienced in the treatment of
long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD)
-AND-
d. Target recommended daily dosage does not exceed 35% of the patient’s total
prescribed daily caloric intake (DCI)
-AND-
e. Patient is receiving disease related dietary management

-AND-
f. If not diagnosed by newborn screening, patient has a history of clinical manifestations
of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders LC-FAOD (e.g., rhabdomyolysis)
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
B. Reauthorization
1. Dojolvi will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Documentation of positive clinical response to Dojolvi therapy (e.g., increased
cardiac efficiency, decreased left ventricular wall mass, decreased incidence of
rhabdomyolysis, etc.)
-AND-
b. Patient is not receiving Dojolvi in combination with any other medium-chain
triglyceride (MCT) product
-AND-
c. Prescribed by a board-certified medical geneticist experienced in the treatment of
long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD)
-AND-
d. Target recommended daily dosage does not exceed 35% of the patient’s total
prescribed daily caloric intake (DCI)
-AND-
e. Patient is receiving disease related dietary management
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific benefit
plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization management
programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization
based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.
Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.
• Supply limits may be in place.
