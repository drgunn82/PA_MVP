1. Background:
Lumryz, Xyrem® (sodium oxybate) and XywavTM are central nervous system depressants indicated
for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy.
Xyway is also indicated for idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) in adults.
Lumryz, Xyrem and Xywav are classified as a Schedule III controlled substance by Federal law. The
active ingredient, sodium oxybate or gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), is listed in the most restrictive
schedule of the Controlled Substances Act (Schedule I). Thus, non-medical uses are classified under
Schedule I.
Lumryz, Xyrem and Xywav are available only through a REMS program with restricted
distribution. The REMS Program provides educational materials to the prescriber and the patient
explaining the risks and proper use of Lumryz, Xyrem and Xywav, and the required prescription
form. Once it is documented that the patient has read and/or understood the materials, the drug will
be shipped to the patient. The REMS Program also recommends patient follow-up every 3 months.
Physicians are expected to report all serious adverse events to the manufacturer.
Members will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.
