Program Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity – Digital Applications
Medication EndeavorRx®, reSET, reSET-O®, Somryst
P&T Approval Date 4/2021, 4/2022, 6/2023, 6/2024
Effective Date 9/1/2024
1. Background:
The program is for prescription digital applications, including but not limited to EndeavorRx, reSET,
reSET-O and Somryst.
EndeavorRx is an FDA-cleared digital application intended to improve attention function as
measured by computer-based testing in children ages 8 to 12 years old with primarily inattentive
or combined-type Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
reSET and reSET-O are FDA-cleared mobile applications that are pharmacy prescription-based
cognitive behavioral therapy treatments for various substance use disorders. The applications are
intended to increase retention of patients in outpatient treatment under the care of a health care
professional by providing cognitive behavioral therapy.
Somryst is an FDA-cleared digital application intended to provide neurobehavioral intervention
in patients 22 years of age and older with chronic insomnia.
A review of the current literature does not support Computer Based Treatment for Cognitive
Behavioral Therapy (CBTCBT) for the treatment of ADHD, as an outpatient therapy to treat
alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, and/or stimulant substance use disorders, or for the treatment of
chronic insomnia.
The studies available for review are limited due to the recent development of the technology.
There is limited evidence showing CBTCBT effectiveness as an adjunct therapy when combined
with clinical monitoring. Though short-term benefits have been seen, long-term efficacy of
CBTCBT has not been determined. CBTCBT is considered unproven until additional studies are
available.
