1. Background:
Kalydeco® (ivacaftor) is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator
indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 1 months and older who have at
least one mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ivacaftor based on clinical and/or in vitro
assay data.
If the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect the
presence of a CFTR mutation followed by verification with bi-directional sequencing when
recommended by the mutation test instructions for use. 1
Members will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization
1. Kalydeco will be approved based upon all of the following criteria:
a. Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF)
-AND-
b. Submission of laboratory results confirming that patient has at least one of the
following mutations in the CFTR gene that is responsive to Kalydeco^:

* Clinical data exist for these mutations.
† Complex/compound mutations where a single allele of the CFTR gene has multiple mutations;
these exist independent of the presence of mutations on the other allele.
-AND-
c. Prescribed by or in consultation with a provider who specializes in the treatment of CF
Authorization will be issued for 12 months.
B. Reauthorization
1. Kalydeco will be approved based on the following criterion:
a. Documentation of positive clinical response to Kalydeco therapy (e.g., improved lung
function, stable lung function)
Authorization will be issued for 12 months.

plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization management
programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-
authorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10)
and/or claim logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program
and/or therapeutic class
• Supply limits may be in place.
