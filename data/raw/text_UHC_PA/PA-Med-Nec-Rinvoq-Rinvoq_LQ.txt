1. Background:
Rinvoq is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. Rinvoq and/or Rinvoq LQ is indicated for the treatment of:
• Adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have had an inadequate
response or intolerance to one or more TNF tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers.
Limitation of Use:
The use of Rinvoq in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic DMARDs, or with potent
immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
• Adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with active psoriatic arthritis who have an
inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers.
Limitation of Use:
Rinvoq/Rinvoq LQ is not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors,
biologic DMARDs, or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine.
• Adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with refractory, moderate to severe atopic
dermatitis whose disease is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products,
including biologics, or when use of those therapies are inadvisable.
Limitation of Use:
Rinvoq is not recommended in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biologic
immunomodulators, or with other immunosuppressants.
• Adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had an inadequate response
or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers.
Limitations of Use:
Rinvoq is not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, biological
therapies for ulcerative colitis, or with other potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and
cyclosporine.
Rinvoq should be discontinued if adequate therapeutic response is not achieved with the 30 mg
dosage. Use the lowest effective dosage needed to maintain response.
• Adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to
one or more TNF blockers.
