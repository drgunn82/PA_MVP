1. Background:
Isotretinoin is indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are
inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or more. “Severe,” by definition, means
“many” as opposed to “few or several” nodules. Isotretinoin should be reserved for patients
with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic
antibiotics. Due to its teratogenicity, isotretinoin is not indicated in patients who are or may
become pregnant.
A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and
prolonged remission of disease in many patients. If a second course of therapy is needed, it
is recommended to wait at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because
experience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off isotretinoin. The
optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not
completed skeletal growth.
