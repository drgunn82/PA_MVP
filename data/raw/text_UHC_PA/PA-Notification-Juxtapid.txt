1. Background:
Juxtapid (lomitapide) is a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor indicated as an
adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering treatments, including LDL apheresis where
available, to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC),
apolipoprotein B (apo B), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) in patients
with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). The safety and efficacy of Juxtapid
have not been established in patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not have HoFH,
including those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). The effect of Juxtapid
on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.
