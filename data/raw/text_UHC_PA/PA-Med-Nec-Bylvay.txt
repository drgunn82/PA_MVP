1. Background:
Bylvay (odevixibat) is an ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor indicated for the treatment of pruritis
in patients aged 3 months or older with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC).
Bylvay is also indicated for the treatment of pruritis in patients 12 months of age and older with
Alagille syndrome (ALGS).
PFIC is a heterogeneous group of liver disorders of autosomal recessive inheritance,
characterized by an early onset of cholestasis (usually during infancy) with pruritus and
malabsorption, which rapidly progresses and ends up as liver failure. Pruritus is the most obvious
and the most unbearable symptom in cholestasis. It has been proposed that it is induced by the
stimulation of nonmyelinated subepidermal free nerve ends because of increased serum bile
acids.
ALGS is a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the JAG1 or Notch2 genes which are
involved in embryonic development in utero. In ALGS patients, multiple organ systems may be
affected by the mutation. In the liver, the mutation causes the bile ducts to abnormally narrow,
malform and reduce in number, leading to bile acid accumulation, cholestasis, and ultimately
progressive liver disease. The cholestatic pruritus experienced by patients with ALGS is among
the most severe in any chronic liver disease and is present in most affected children by the third
year of life.
Conventional treatments for pruritis associated with PFIC or Alagille syndrome include
uroseoxycholic acid (UCDA), antihistamines (e,g., diphenhydramine), bile acid sequestrants
(e.g., cholestyramine), rifampin, naltrexone and sertraline.
Limitation of Use:
Bylvay may not be effective in a subgroup of PFIC type 2 patients with specific ABCB11
variants resulting in non-functional or complete absence of bile salt export pump protein (BSEP-
3).
