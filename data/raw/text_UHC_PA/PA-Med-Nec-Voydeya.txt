(1) Flow cytometry analysis confirming presence of PNH clones
-AND-
(2) Laboratory results, signs, and/or symptoms attributed to PNH (e.g., abdominal
pain, anemia, dyspnea, extreme fatigue, smooth muscle dystonia,

extravascular hemolysis (EVH), increased or stabilization of hemoglobin levels,
reduction in transfusions, improvement in hemolysis, etc.)]
-AND-
b. Patient continues to receive Voydeya in combination with complement protein C5
inhibitor eculizumab or Ultomiris (ravulizumab) for PNH
-AND-
