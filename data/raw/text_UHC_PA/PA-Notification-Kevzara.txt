1. Background:
Kevzara (sarilumab) is an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist indicated for treatment of
adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an
inadequate response or intolerance to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic
drugs (DMARDs).1 Examples of DMARDs commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis include methotrexate, leflunomide, and sulfasalazine.2,3 Kevzara is also indicated for
the treatment of adult patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) who have had an
inadequate response to corticosteroids or who cannot tolerate corticosteroid taper and for the
treatment of patients who weigh 63 kg or greater with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic
arthritis (pJIA).
