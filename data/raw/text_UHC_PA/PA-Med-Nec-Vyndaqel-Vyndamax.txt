1. Background:
Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine) and Vyndamax™ (tafamidis) are transthyretin stabilizers
indicated for the treatment of the cardiomyopathy of wild type or hereditary transthyretin-
mediated amyloidosis in adults to reduce cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular-related
hospitalization.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Transthyretin (ATTR)-mediated amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM)
1. Initial Authorization
a. Vyndaqel/Vyndamax will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
(1) Diagnosis of transthyretin (ATTR)-mediated amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy
(ATTR-CM)
-AND-
(2) One of the following:
(a) Documentation that the patient has a pathogenic TTR mutation (e.g., V30M)
-OR-
(b) Cardiac or noncardiac tissue biopsy demonstrating histologic confirmation of
ATTR amyloid deposits
-OR-
(c) All of the following:
i. Echocardiagram or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of
amyloidosis
-AND-
ii. Radionuclide imaging (99mTc-DPD, 99mTc-PYP, or 99m Tc-HMDP) showing
grade 2 or 3 cardiac uptake*

Onpattro (patisiran), Tegsedi (inotersen), or Wainua (eplontersen)]
Authorization will be issued for 12 months.
2. Reauthorization
a. Vyndaqel/Vyndamax will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
