1. Background:
Sunosi is a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (DNRI) indicated to improve
wakefulness in adult patients with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy or
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
Limitations of Use: Sunosi is not indicated to treat the underlying airway obstruction in OSA.
Ensure that the underlying airway obstruction is treated (e.g., with continuous positive airway
pressure [CPAP]) for at least one month prior to initiating Sunosi for excessive daytime sleepiness.
Modalities to treat the underlying airway obstruction should be continued during treatment with
Sunosi. Sunosi is not a substitute for these modalities.
Members will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.
