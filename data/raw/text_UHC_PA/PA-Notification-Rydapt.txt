Rydapt® (midostaurin) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that is FLT3 mutation-positive, in combination

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends Rydapt for treatment of
myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and FGFR1 or FLT3 rearrangements.
