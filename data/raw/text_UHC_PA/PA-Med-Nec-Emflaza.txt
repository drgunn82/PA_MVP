1. Background:
Emflaza (deflazacort)* is a corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (DMD) in patients 2 years of age and older.1
In a report from the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of
Neurology, regarding selection of prednisone versus deflazacort in the treatment of DMD, the
following statement is made: “prednisone and deflazacort are possibly equally effective for
improving motor function in patients with DMD.3 Three Class III studies directly compared
prednisone and deflazacort. In one study, deflazacort and prednisone were shown to have
equally beneficial effects on functional motor outcomes, pulmonary function, and
development of scoliosis over 5.49 years (SD 1.98).4 In another study, prednisone and
deflazacort were equally effective in improving motor function and functional performance
over a 12- month treatment period.5 A final study reported equivalent cardiac outcome in
deflazacort- and prednisone-treated groups over a mean follow-up period of 3.0 years (SD
2.5).6
The UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee has determined that Emflaza is
Therapeutically Equivalent to prednisone in the treatment of DMD.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
1. Published clinical evidence shows Emflaza* is likely to produce equivalent therapeutic
results as other available corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone); therefore, Emflaza* is not
medically necessary for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific
benefit plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization
management programs may apply.
*Emflaza is typically excluded from coverage. Tried/Failed criteria may be in place. Please refer
to plan specifics to determine exclusion status.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-
authorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-
10) and/or claim logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by
program and/or therapeutic class.
