Program Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity
Medication Tryvio™ (aprocitentan)
P&T Approval Date 6/2024, 2/2025
Effective Date 5/1/2025
1. Background:
Tryvio (aprocitentan) is an endothelin receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of
hypertension in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, to lower blood pressure in adult
patients who are not adequately controlled on other drugs. Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined
as above-goal elevated blood pressure (BP) in a patient despite the concurrent use of 3
antihypertensive drug classes, commonly including a long-acting calcium channel blocker, a
blocker of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin
receptor blocker), and a diuretic. The antihypertensive drugs should be administered at maximum
or maximally tolerated daily doses.1
Tryvio is only available through a restricted distribution program called the Tryvio REMS.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization
1. Tryvio will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Diagnosis of resistant hypertension
-AND-
b. One of the following:
1) Systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg on two consecutive measurements despite
maximally tolerated antihypertensive treatment
-OR-
2) Diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg on two consecutive measurements despite
maximally tolerated antihypertensive treatment
-AND-
c. Patient has been previously treated with all of the following antihypertensive classes
for an adequate duration (minimum 4 weeks each) at a maximally tolerated dose:
1) Maximally tolerated blocker of the renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin-

receptor blocker (ARB) (e.g., candesartan, valsartan)]

4) Maximally tolerated mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist [MRA (e.g.,
spironolactone, eplerenone)]
-AND-
d. Provider attests other causes of hypertension have been excluded (e.g., secondary
causes [e.g., primary hyperaldosteronism], white coat effect, medication
nonadherence)
-AND-
e. Used as an adjunct to lifestyle modification (e.g., dietary or caloric restriction,
exercise, behavioral support, community-based program)
-AND-
f. Tryvio will be used in combination with at least 3 antihypertensive medications from
different classes at maximally tolerated doses
-AND-
g. Prescribed by or in consultation with a specialist experienced in the treatment of
resistant hypertension (e.g., cardiologist, nephrologist)
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
B. Reauthorization
1. Tryvio will be approved based on both of the following criteria:
a. Documentation the patient is receiving clinical benefit to Tryvio therapy
-AND-
b. Tryvio will be used in combination with at least 3 antihypertensive medications from
different classes at maximally tolerated doses
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
