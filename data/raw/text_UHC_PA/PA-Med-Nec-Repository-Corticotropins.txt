1. Background:
Acthar Gel® (repository corticotropin injection) and Purified Cortrophin Gel™ (repository
corticotropin injection USP) are adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) analogues medically
necessary for:
• Infantile Spasms: As monotherapy for the treatment of infantile spasms in infants and
children under 2 years of age.
• Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (i.e., OMS, Kinsbourne Syndrome)
The Acthar Gel and Purified Cortrophin Gel package inserts have listed other conditions in
which they may be used without providing supporting clinical evidence. Since Acthar Gel
and Purified Cortrophin Gel are more costly than alternatives that are at least as likely to
produce equivalent therapeutic results, UHCP has determined that use of Acthar Gel and
Purified Cortrophin Gel is not medically necessary for treatment of the following disorders
and diseases: multiple sclerosis; rheumatic; collagen; dermatologic; allergic states;
ophthalmic; respiratory; and edematous state.
Coverage will be provided for members who meet the following criteria.
