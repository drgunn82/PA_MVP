1. Background:
Cimzia (certolizumab) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker indicated for reducing signs
and symptoms of Crohn's disease (CD) and maintaining clinical response in adult patients
with moderately to severely active disease who have had an inadequate response to
conventional therapy. Cimzia is also indicated for the treatment of adults with moderately to
severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic
arthritis (PsA), treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis (SpA), treatment of
adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (PS) who are candidates for systemic therapy
or phototherapy, for the treatment of adults with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-
axSpA), with objective signs of inflammation, and for the treatment of active polyarticular
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in patients 2 years of age and older.
