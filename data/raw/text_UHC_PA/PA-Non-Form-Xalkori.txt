Effective Date 5/1/2025
1. Background:
Xalkori (crizotinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-
positive or ROS1-positive as detected by an FDA-approved test. It is also approved for pediatric
patients 1 year of age and older and young adults with relapsed or refractory, systemic anaplastic
large cell lymphoma (ALCL) that is ALK-positive and adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age
and older with unresectable, recurrent, or refractory inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT)
that is ALK-positive. The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends
the use of Xalkori as a single-agent for the treatment of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor
(IMT) with ALK translocation, in treatment of MET-amplification positive NSCLC, MET exon
14 skipping mutation NSCLC, in treatment of ROS1-positive or ALK-positive brain metastases
from NSCLC, in histiocytic neoplasms that are positive for ALK rearrangement, and in metastatic
or unresectable cutaneous melanoma that is ROS1 gene fusion-positive as second-line or
subsequent therapy for disease progression, intolerance, and/or projected risk of progression with
BRAF-targeted therapy.
