1. Background:
Xolair (omalizumab) is an anti-IgE antibody indicated for:
• Moderate to severe persistent asthma in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older
with a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and symptoms that are
inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids
• Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in adult patients 18 years of age and older
with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids, as add-on maintenance treatment
• IgE-mediated food allergy in adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older for the reduction
of allergic reactions (Type I), including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure
to one or more foods. To be used in conjunction with food allergen avoidance.
• Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older who
remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment
Limitations of Use:
• Xolair is not indicated for acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.
• Xolair is not indicated for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.
• Xolair is not indicated for other forms of urticaria.

Program Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity – Xolair (omalizumab)
Change Control

11/2021 Added coverage criteria for patients established on therapy under
UnitedHealthcare medical benefit. Updated prescriber requirement for
initial authorization and removed prescriber requirement for
reauthorization.
2/2022 Added Tezspire to list of agents not to be used in combination with
Xolair for all indications. Added a requirement that Xolair cannot be
used in combination with a similar agent to the chronic urticaria criteria.
Updated coverage criteria for CRSwNP. Updated references. Added
footnote to support FDA labeled first line requirements.
9/2022 Updated coverage criteria for nasal polyps to more closely align with
label which does not specify laterality of nasal polyps and includes
inadequate response to intranasal corticosteroids. Updated references.
7/2023 Updated coverage criteria for severe asthma to align with GINA &
ERS/ATS guidelines. Added/updated examples of ICS-containing
maintenance medications and removed coverage for patients currently
dependent on maintenance therapy with oral corticosteroids. Updated
references.
10/2023 Annual review. Removed prescriber requirement for initial
authorizations for patients established on therapy under UHC medical
prior authorization. Added requirement patient is not receiving Xolair
with other similar treatments for chronic urticaria reauthorization.
4/2024 Added criteria for new indication, IgE-mediated food allergy. Updated
background and references.
