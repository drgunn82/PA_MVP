1. Background:
Somatropin (Genotropin®*, Humatrope®*, Norditropin®, Nutropin AQ NuSpin®*, Omnitrope®,
Saizen®*, Zomacton®*) is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients with growth failure due
to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (GH), growth hormone deficiency
(GHD), short stature associated with Turner syndrome or Noonan syndrome, idiopathic short
stature (ISS), short-stature or growth failure in short stature homeobox-containing gene
homeobox (SHOX) gene deficiency, growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome, short stature in
children born small for gestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth by 2 years to 4 years of
age, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) up to the time of renal transplantation., growth failure in
children with chronic renal insufficiency up to the time of transplant, short bowel syndrome in
patients receiving specialized nutritional support, and HIV-associated wasting. Somatropin is also
indicated for replacement of endogenous growth hormone (GH) in adults with confirmed GH
deficiency (GHD).
Ngenla™ (somatrogon-ghla), is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 3 years and
older who have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous GH.
Skytrofa™ (lonapegsomatropin-tcgd) is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year and
older who weigh at least 11.5 kg and have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of
endogenous GH.
Sogroya®*(somapacitan-beco) is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 2.5 years
and older who have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous GD. It is also
indicated for the replacement of endogenous GD in adults with GHD.
Serostim® (somatropin) is indicated for the treatment of HIV patients with wasting or cachexia to
increase lean body mass and body weight and improve physical endurance.
Zorbtive® (somatropin) is indicated for the treatment of short bowel syndrome in adult patients
receiving specialized nutritional support.

Increlex® (mecasermin) is indicated for the treatment of growth failure in pediatric patients 2
years of age and older with severe primary insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) deficiency or with
GH gene deletion that have developed neutralizing antibodies to GH.
Coverage Information
Since short stature in the absence of defined pathology is not a sickness or injury, growth
hormone is not a covered health service for these indications. The standard UnitedHealthcare
Pharmacy Rider explicitly excludes coverage of growth hormone for short stature caused by
heredity and not by a diagnosed medical condition.

Essential versus Nonessential Use
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010 includes a mandate that prohibits
annual dollar maximum limits for “essential” benefits. A strict definition of “essential” was not provided
in PPACA or in federal health care regulations published as of the date this program was revised.
UnitedHealthcare defines an “essential” use of growth hormone as therapy to treat a deficiency as part of
chronic disease management. Other uses such as replacement therapy in a disorder where a deficiency is
not noted are considered “nonessential.”
This information applies to groups with benefit caps in place for growth hormone therapy. If the diagnosis
is considered an essential use of the medication, the cap will not apply. For these cases, an override for
the cap amount will be entered at the same time the authorization (if criteria met) is entered for the
medication. If the diagnosis is a nonessential use of the medication, then only the authorization for the
medication will be entered.

3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-

and/or claim logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program
and/or therapeutic class.
• Supply limits may be in place.
