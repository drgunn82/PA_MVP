1. Background:
Retevmo (selpercatinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
locally advanced or metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Retevmo is also indicated, with approvals under accelerated approval,
for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older with: advanced or
metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) with a RET mutation, as detected by an FDA-
approved test, who require systemic therapy; advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer with a RET
gene fusion, as detected by an FDA-approved test, who require systemic therapy and who are
radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate); and locally advanced or
metastatic solid tumors with a RET gene fusion, as detected by an FDA-approved test, that have
progressed on or following prior systemic treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative
treatment options.1
Indications approved under accelerated approval are based on overall response rate and duration of
response. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and
description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s).
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) guideline also recommends use of
Retevmo as single-agent therapy for RET fusion target for the treatment of the following
histiocyctic neoplasms: Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis, Erdheim-Chester disease, and Rosai-
Dorfman disease.
