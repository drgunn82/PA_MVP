1. Background:
Ocaliva (obeticholic acid), a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist, is indicated for the treatment of

with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.
This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on a reduction in alkaline
phosphatase (ALP). An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not been
established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and
description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.1
