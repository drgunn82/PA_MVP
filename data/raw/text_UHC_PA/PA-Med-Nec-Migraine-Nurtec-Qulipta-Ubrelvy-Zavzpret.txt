1. Background:
Nurtec ODT (rimegepant), Ubrelvy (ubrogepant) and Zavzpret (zavegepant) are calcitonin gene-
related peptide receptor antagonists indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without
aura in adults. Nurtec ODT is also indicated for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in
adults and Qulipta (atogepant) is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults
The American Headache Society recommends the use of NSAIDs (including aspirin), non-
opioid analgesics, acetaminophen, or caffeinated analgesic combinations (e.g.,
aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine) for mild‐to‐moderate attacks and migraine‐specific agents
(i.e.,triptans, dihydroergotamine [DHE]) for moderate or severe attacks and mild‐to‐moderate
attacks that respond poorly to NSAIDs or caffeinated combinations.
Preventive treatment selection is based on evidence of efficacy, tolerability, patient preference,
headache subtype, and comorbidities. The American Academy of Neurology guidelines note that
antiepileptic drugs (divalproex sodium, valproate sodium, topiramate) and beta-blockers
(metoprolol, propranolol, timolol) have established efficacy and that antidepressants
(amitriptyline, venlafaxine) and beta-blockers (atenolol, nadolol) are probably effective for the
preventive treatment of migraine headache.
This program requires a member to try lower cost options prior to receiving coverage for Nurtec
ODT, Qulipta, Ubrelvy or Zavzpret.
