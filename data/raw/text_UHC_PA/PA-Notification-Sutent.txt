1. Background:
Sutent® (sunitinib malate) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or intolerance to Gleevec®
(imatinib mesylate); treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC); adjuvant treatment of
adult patients at high risk of recurrent RCC following nephrectomy; and treatment of
progressive, well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET) in patients with
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) recommends use of Sutent for
medullary, follicular, oncocytic, or papillary thyroid carcinoma; chordoma; meningiomas;
thymic carcinoma; and treatment of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and FMS-
like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) rearrangement. NCCN also approves the use of Sutent for other
soft tissue sarcomas: alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), angiosarcoma, solitary fibrous
tumor/hemangiopericytoma, and extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma.
