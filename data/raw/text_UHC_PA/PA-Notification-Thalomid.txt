1. Background:
Thalomid (thalidomide) is a synthetic glutamic acid derivative indicated for the treatment of
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) in combination with dexamethasone. It
is also indicated for the acute treatment of cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and as maintenance therapy for prevention and suppression
of the cutaneous manifestations of ENL recurrence. It is not indicated as monotherapy for such
ENL treatment in the presence of moderate to severe neuritis.1
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends the use of Thalomid for
treatment of histiocytic neoplasms – Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Rosai-Dorman disease,
Castleman disease, pediatric medulloblastoma, and kaposi sarcoma.2
Because of the risk of serious malformations if given during pregnancy, the manufacturer has an
extensive risk management program requiring registration by patients, prescribers and dispensing
pharmacies. Additional information about the Thalomid Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy
(REMS) [Thalomid REMS®] program may be found at http://www.thalomidrems.com/.3
