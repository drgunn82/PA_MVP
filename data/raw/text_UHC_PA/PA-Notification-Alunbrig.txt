1. Background:
Alunbrig (brigatinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends Alunbrig as first-line
therapy for ALK-positive recurrent, advanced, or metastatic NSCLC, for the treatment of
inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) with ALK translocation, ALK-positive metastatic
brain cancer from NSCLC, and as first-line or subsequent therapy for anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK)-fusion targeted relapsed/refractory, symptomatic Erdheim-Chester Disease
(ECD). The NCCN also recommends Alunbrig for ALK-positive relapsed or refractory
anaplastic large cell lymphoma as palliative intent therapy or second-line and subsequent
therapy.
