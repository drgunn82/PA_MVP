1. Background:
Fasenra (benralizumab) is an interleukin-5 receptor alpha-directed cytolytic monoclonal
antibody indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of patients with severe asthma aged 6
years and older, and with an eosinophilic phenotype.
Fasenra is not used for treatment of other eosinophilic conditions or for relief of acute
bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.

(b) Documentation of positive clinical response to Fasenra therapy as
demonstrated by at least one of the following:
i. Reduction in the frequency of exacerbations
ii. Decreased utilization of rescue medications
iii. Increase in percent predicted FEV1 from pretreatment baseline
iv. Reduction in severity or frequency of asthma-related symptoms
(e.g., wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, etc.)

consistently less than 20)
ii. Two or more bursts of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days each
in the previous 12 months
iii. Asthma-related emergency treatment (e.g., emergency room visit,
hospital admission, or unscheduled physician’s office visit for nebulizer
or other urgent treatment)
iv. Airflow limitation (e.g., after appropriate bronchodilator withhold
forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] less than 80% predicted
[in the face of reduced FEV1/forced vital capacity [FVC] defined as

Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.
• Supply limitations may be in place.
• Medical Necessity may be in place.
• The prefilled syringe is typically covered under the medical benefit. Please refer to the United
Healthcare Medical Benefit Drug Policy: “Respiratory Interleukins (Cinqair®, Fasenra®, and
