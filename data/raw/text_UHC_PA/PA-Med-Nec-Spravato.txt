Effective Date 5/1/2025
1. Background:
Spravato® (esketamine) is a non-competitive N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist
indicated for the treatment of:
• treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in adults, as monotherapy or in conjunction with an oral
antidepressant.
• depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) with acute suicidal
ideation or behavior in conjunction with an oral antidepressant.
Limitations of Use: The effectiveness of Spravato in preventing suicide or in reducing suicidal
ideation or behavior has not been demonstrated. Use of Spravato does not preclude the need for
hospitalization if clinically warranted, even if patients experience improvement after an initial
dose of Spravato. Spravato is not approved as an anesthetic agent. The safety and effectiveness
of Spravato as an anesthetic agent have not been established.
Because of the risks of serious adverse outcomes resulting from sedation, dissociation, and abuse
and misuse, Spravato is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Spravato REMS
For the purposes of this program, a trial and failure of a given antidepressant is defined as the
patient unable to achieve a clinical meaningful improvement of the maximally tolerated dose(s)
for at least 8 weeks.
