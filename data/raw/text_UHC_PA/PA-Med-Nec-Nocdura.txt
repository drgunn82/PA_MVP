1. Background:
Nocdurna (desmopressin acetate) sublingual tablets are indicated for the treatment of nocturia
due to nocturnal polyuria in adults who awaken at least 2 times per night to void. In clinical
trials, nocturnal polyuria was defined as nighttime urine production exceeding one-third of the
24-hour urine production. Prior to initiating treatment with Nocdurna, patients should be
evaluated for possible causes of nocturia and to optimize the treatment of underlying
conditions that may be contributing to the nocturia.
Desmopressin should be avoided in older adults (those 65 or older) due to the risk of
hyponatremia. This medication is included in the American Geriatrics Society Beers Criteria.
Nocdurna has a Black Box Warning for hyponatremia listed in the FDA prescribing
information. Nocdurna use is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or a history of
hyponatremia, SIADH, eGFR <50 mL/min/1.7m2, uncontrolled hypertension, and New York
Heart Association Class II – IV congestive heart failure. See package insert for full listing of
contraindications and safety warnings.
This prior authorization program is intended to ensure appropriate prescribing of Nocdurna
prior to initiating therapy.
