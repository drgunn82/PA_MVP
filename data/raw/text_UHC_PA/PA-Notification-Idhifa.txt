combination with azacitidine, in patients with IDH2-mutated AML for treatment induction when
not a candidate for intensive induction therapy, as follow-up after induction therapy following
response to previous lower intensity therapy with the same regimen, or as consolidation therapy
as continuation of low-intensity regimen used for induction.
