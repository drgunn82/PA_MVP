1. Background:
Tocilizumab [Actemra (tocilizumab) and Tyenne (tocilizumab-aazg)] is an interleukin-6 (IL-6)
receptor antagonist, available in both an intravenous and a subcutaneous formulation.

moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one
or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). It is also indicated for giant cell
arteritis in adult patients, the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis
(PJIA) and active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) in patients 2 years of age and
older, and for slowing the rate of decline in pulmonary function in adult patients with systemic
sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).
