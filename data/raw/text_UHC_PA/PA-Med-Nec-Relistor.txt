1. Background:
Amitiza®- (lubiprostone)*, Relistor (methylnaltrexone bromide) and Symporic® (naldemedine) are
opioid antagonists indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult
patients with chronic non-cancer pain including patients with chronic pain related to prior cancer
or its treatment who do not require frequent (e.g., weekly) opioid dosage escalation. Relistor
injection is also indicated for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with
advanced illness or pain caused by active cancer who require opioid dosage escalation for
palliative care. Physicians and patients should periodically assess the need for continued
treatment with Relistor.
This prior authorization program is intended to encourage the use of lower cost alternatives. This
program requires a member to try lower-cost options before providing coverage for Relistor.
