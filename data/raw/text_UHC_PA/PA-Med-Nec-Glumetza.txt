1. Background:
According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) metformin is the preferred initial
pharmacological agent for type 2 diabetes if not contraindicated. Metformin osmotic extended-
release (generic Fortamet), metformin extended-release (generic Glucophage XR) and
Glumetza (metformin extended-release modified release) only differ in their extended-release
formulation technology and excipient content. Treatment guidelines do not specify which
metformin formulation should be selected for diabetes management.
This program requires a member to try metformin immediate-release (generic Glucophage) and
metformin extended-release (generic Glucophage XR) prior to receiving coverage for
metformin osmotic extended-release (generic Fortamet)* and also requires an additional trial of
metformin osmotic extended-release (generic Fortamet)* prior to receiving coverage for
Glumetza*.
