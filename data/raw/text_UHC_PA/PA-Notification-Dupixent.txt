1. Background:
Dupixent® (dupilumab) is an interleukin-4 receptor alpha antagonist indicated for treatment of
patients aged 6 months and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis whose disease is not
adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not
advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. Dupixent is also
indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged
6 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid dependent asthma,
as an add-on maintenance treatment in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with
inadequately controlled chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), for the
treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older, weighing at least 15 kg, with
eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), for adult patients with prurigo nodularis (PN), as add-on
maintenance treatment of adult patients with inadequately controlled chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and an eosinophilic phenotype, and pediatric patients aged 12 years
and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) who remain symptomatic despite H1
antihistamine treatment..
Limitation of Use:
Dupixent is not for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.
