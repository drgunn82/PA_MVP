1. Background:
Xolair (omalizumab) is an anti-IgE antibody indicated for:
• Moderate to severe persistent asthma in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older
with a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and symptoms that
are inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids
• Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) in adult patients 18 years of age and
older with inadequate response to nasal corticosteroids, as add-on maintenance treatment
• IgE-mediated food allergy in adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older for the
reduction of allergic reactions (Type I), including anaphylaxis, that may occur with
accidental exposure to one or more foods. To be used in conjunction with food allergen
avoidance
• Chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older who
remain symptomatic despite H1 antihistamine treatment
Limitations of Use:
• Xolair is not indicated for acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.
• Xolair is not indicated for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including
anaphylaxis.
• Xolair is not indicated for other forms of urticaria.
