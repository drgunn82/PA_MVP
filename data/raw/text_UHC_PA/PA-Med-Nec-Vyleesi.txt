1. Background:
Vyleesi is indicated for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired, generalized
hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), as characterized by low sexual desire that causes
marked distress or interpersonal difficulty and is not due to a co-existing medical or psychiatric
condition, problems within the relationship, or the effects of a medication or other drug substance.
Acquired HSDD refers to HSDD that develops in a patient who previously had no problems with
sexual desire. Generalized HSDD refers to HSDD that occurs regardless of the type of stimulation,
