1. Background:
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)1 recommends that clinicians engage in
shared, informed decision making with patients who are at increased risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD).
The USPSTF recommends that adults without a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (i.e.,
myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke) use a low- to moderate-dose statin for the
prevention of CVD events and mortality when all of the following criteria are met: 1) they are
aged 40 to 75 years; 2) they have 1 or more CVD risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia, diabetes,
hypertension, or smoking); and 3) they have an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular
event of 10% or greater. (http://tools.acc.org/ASCVD-Risk-estimator/)
This program is designed to evaluate whether or not members meet the primary prevention
criteria for obtaining coverage of low-to moderate-dose lipid lowering therapy (statins) at
zero dollar cost share.
2. Coverage Criteria:
A. Upon request, coverage at zero dollar cost share will be approved based on all of the
following criteria:
1. Member is between the ages of 40 and 75
-AND-
2. Medication is being used for primary prevention of CVD (i.e., member has no history
of cardiovascular events)
-AND-
3. Member has one or more risk factors for CVD (i.e., dyslipidemia, diabetes,
hypertension, or smoking)
-AND-
4. Member has an estimated 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10% or greater

Authorization will be issued for zero copay with deductible bypass for 24 months. If zero
dollar cost share criteria is not met the requested drug will default to plan coverage
requirements.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-
authorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-
10) and/or claim logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by
program and/or therapeutic class.
