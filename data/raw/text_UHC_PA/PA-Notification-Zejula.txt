1. Background:
Zejula (niraparib) is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor indicated for the
maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or
primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based
chemotherapy. Zejula is also indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with
recurrent epithelial ovarian,
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline
BRCA-mutated (gBRCAmut) who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based
chemotherapy.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends Zejula therapy as recurrence
therapy in epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer for persistent disease or
recurrence in combination with bevacizumab for platinum-sensitive disease, in BRCA2-altered
uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS) as a second-line or subsequent therapy for advanced,
recurrent/metastatic, or inoperable disease as a single agent, and in castration-resistant distant
metastatic (M1) prostate cancer.
