1. Background:
Venclexta (venetoclax) is a BCL-2 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Venclexta is also
indicated in combination with azacitidine, or decitabine, or low-dose cytarabine for the
treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults who are age 75 years or
older, or who have comorbidities that preclude use of intensive induction chemotherapy.
In addition, the National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) recommends the use of
Venclexta in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL); in newly diagnosed, relapsed/refractory, and
blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) AML; relapsed/refractory hairy cell
leukemia; mantle cell lymphoma as second line or subsequent therapy; in relapsed or
progressive multiple myeloma with t(11;14) translocation; for relapsed/refractory systemic light
chain amyloidosis with t(11;14) translocation; in previously treated Waldenstrom
macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma; in accelerated/blast phase
myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) with disease progression; in chronic myelomonocytic
leukemia (CMML); and in higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes.
