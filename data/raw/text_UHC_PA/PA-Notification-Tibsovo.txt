1. Background:
Tibsovo® (ivosidenib) is an isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of
adult patients with a susceptible isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) mutation with relapsed or
refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or in combination with azacitidine or as monotherapy
for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML in adults who are > 75 years old, or who have
comorbidities that preclude the use of intensive induction chemotherapy. Tibsovo is indicated for
the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with
a susceptible IDH1 mutation. Tibsovo is also indicated in adult patients with a susceptible IDH1
mutation with locally advanced or metastatic cholangiocarcinoma who have previously been
treated.
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) guideline also recommends the use of
Tibsovo in susceptible IDH1 mutation-positive AML patients who are 60 to 74 years old and
receiving Tibsovo as treatment induction when not a candidate for intensive remission induction
therapy or declines, or as post-induction therapy following response to previous lower intensity
therapy with the same regimen. The NCCN guidelines also recommend the use of Tibsovo in
IDH1 mutation-positive patients with either conventional (grades 1-3) or dedifferentiated
chondrosarcoma, recurrent or progressive IDH mutant 1p19q codeleted oligodendroglioma WHO
Grade 2 or 3, and recurrent or progressive IDH-mutant astrocytoma WHO Grade 2, 3, or 4.
