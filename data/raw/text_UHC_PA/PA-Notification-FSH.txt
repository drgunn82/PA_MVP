1. Background:
The body produces two types of gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and
luteinizing hormone (LH), both of which play a role in fertility and human reproduction. After
they are produced by the pituitary gland, gonadotropins trigger production of other sex hormones
which then promote production of egg and sperm. Gonadotropins are used in the treatment of
infertility, a disease of the reproductive system defined as one of the following:
• inability to achieve a successful pregnancy due to an individual’s medical, sexual, or
reproductive history;
• failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual
intercourse when the female partner is less than 35 years;
• failure to achieve a pregnancy after 6 months or more of regular unprotected sexual
intercourse when the female partner is 35 years or older
Follistim AQ (follitropin beta) is indicated for induction of ovulation and pregnancy in
anovulatory infertile women in whom the cause of infertility is functional and not due to primary
ovarian failure. It is also indicated for pregnancy in normal ovulatory women undergoing ovarian
stimulation as part of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
cycle. In males, Follistim AQ is indicated for induction of spermatogenesis in men with primary
and secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) in whom the cause of infertility is not due
to primary testicular failure.
Gonal-f and Gonal-f RFF (follitropin alfa) are indicated for the induction of ovulation and
pregnancy in oligo-anovulatory infertile women in whom the cause of infertility is functional and
not due to primary ovarian failure. Gonal-f and Gonal-f RFF are also indicated for the
development of multiple follicles in ovulatory women participating in an Assisted Reproductive
Technology (ART) program. Gonal-f is indicated for the induction of spermatogenesis in men with
primary and secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism for whom the cause of infertility is not
due to primary testicular failure.
The clinically appropriate dosing for FSH agents is 450 IU/day or less when used for an ART cycle,
or 225 IU/day or less when used for ovulation induction or ovarian stimulation, for not more than 14
days of treatment. Exceeding this daily dose and duration of treatment has not been proven to be
efficacious in terms of pregnancy outcome.

a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific benefit
plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization management
programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Programs:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization
based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.
Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.
• Supply limits and/or Step Therapy may be in place.
*Infertility is typically excluded from coverage for UnitedHealthcare. Please refer to member’s
specific benefits for coverage determination.
ǂ OptumHealth review only: Please refer to the Clinical Policy on Follicle Stimulating Hormones
(FSH) Used in the Treatment of Infertility for state-specific requirements that may apply.
§ OptumHealth review only: Subsequent authorizations will be reviewed according to the Infertility
Clinical Performance Guideline.
