1. Background:
The body produces two types of gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing
hormone (LH), both of which play a role in fertility and human reproduction. After they are produced
by the pituitary gland, gonadotropins trigger production of other sex hormones which then promote
production of egg and sperm. Gonadotropins are used in the treatment of infertility, a disease of the
reproductive system defined as one of the following:
• inability to achieve a successful pregnancy due to an individual’s medical, sexual, or reproductive
history;
• failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse
when the female partner is less than 35 years;
• failure to achieve a pregnancy after 6 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse
when the female partner is 35 years or older
Gonal-f and Gonal-f RFF (follitropin alfa) are indicated for the induction of ovulation and pregnancy
in oligo-anovulatory infertile women in whom the cause of infertility is functional and not due to
primary ovarian failure. Gonal-f and Gonal-f RFF are also indicated for the development of multiple
follicles in ovulatory women participating in an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) program.
Gonal-f is indicated for the induction of spermatogenesis in men with primary and secondary
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism for whom the cause of infertility is not due to primary testicular
failure.
Follistim AQ (follitropin beta) is indicated for induction of ovulation and pregnancy in anovulatory
infertile women in whom the cause of infertility is functional and not due to primary ovarian failure.
It is also indicated for pregnancy in normal ovulatory women undergoing ovarian stimulation as part
of an in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle. In males, Follistim
AQ is indicated for induction of spermatogenesis in men with primary and secondary
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) in whom the cause of infertility is not due to primary
testicular failure.
Menopur (menotropins) is indicated for the development of multiple follicles and pregnancy in
women participating in an assisted reproductive technology (ART) program. Human menopausal
gonadotropins (hMG) is used for the treatment of ovulation induction in women with ovulatory
dysfunction including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who failed on clomiphene as well for
ovulation induction in the setting of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
hMG is also used for induction of spermatogenesis in men with primary and secondary
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in whom the cause of infertility is not due to primary testicular
failure.

The clinically appropriate dosing for hMG agents when used in an ART cycle without an FSH
product is 450 IU/day or less for not more than 14 days of treatment. When used as part of a mixed
stimulation protocol (hMG + FSH) or when used alone for ovulation induction or ovarian stimulation,
the clinically appropriate maximum dosing for hMG agents is 225 IU/day and 150 IU/day,
respectively. Exceeding this daily dose and duration of treatment has not been proven to be
efficacious in terms of pregnancy outcome. The clinically appropriate dosing for gonadotropin (FSH
or hMG alone or in combination) agents is 450 IU/day or less when used for an ART cycle, or 225
IU/day and 150 IU/day or less when used for ovulation induction or ovarian stimulation, respectively,
for not more than 14 days of treatment. Exceeding this daily dose and duration of treatment has not
been proven to be efficacious in terms of pregnancy outcome.
This is an optional program that is put in place for clients or businesses that have elected to provide
coverage for gonadotropins, managed through the Optum Fertility Solutions program.
