A. Background:
Jakafi® (ruxolitinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for treatment of patients with intermediate or
high-risk myelofibrosis, including primary myelofibrosis (PMF), post-polycythemia vera
myelofibrosis and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis. It is also indicated in patients
with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea.
It is also indicated for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease and
chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy in adult and
pediatric patients 12 years and older.
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends Jakafi for the treatment
of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, accelerated/blast phase myeloproliferative
neoplasm, lymphoid, myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and JAK2 rearrangement,
myelodysplastic syndromes, pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-Cell Lymphomas, and
management of CAR-T-cell and immunotherapy-related toxicities.
Coverage Information:
Members will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage. For members under the age of 19
years, the prescription will automatically process without a coverage review.
Some states mandate benefit coverage for off-label use of medications for some diagnoses or under
some circumstances. Some states also mandate usage of other Compendium references. Where such
mandates apply, they supersede language in the benefit document or in the notification criteria.
