Program Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity
Medication Symdeko® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor)
P&T Approval Date 2/2018, 2/2019, 8/2019, 8/2020, 8/2021, 8/2022, 6/2023, 6/2024, 6/2025
Effective Date 9/1/2025
1. Background:
Symdeko is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, indicated for the treatment of patients
with cystic fibrosis (CF) age 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation
or who have at least one mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) gene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro data and/or clinical
evidence.
If the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect
the presence of a CFTR mutation followed by verification with bi-directional sequencing when
recommended by the mutation test instructions for use.
Members will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization
1. Symdeko will be approved based upon all of the following criteria:
a. Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF)
-AND-
b. Submission of laboratory results documenting one of the following:
(1) The patient is homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.
-OR-
(2) The patient has at least one of the following mutations in the CFTR gene that is
responsive to Symdeko^:

mutations can be referenced in the Symdeko Prescribing Information.

-AND-
c. Prescribed by or in consultation with a provider who specializes in the treatment of CF
Authorization will be issued for 12 months.
B. Reauthorization
1. Symdeko will be approved based on the following criterion:
a. Documentation of positive clinical response to Symdeko therapy (e.g., improved lung
function, stable lung function)
Authorization will be issued for 12 months.
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific benefit
plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization management
programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-
authorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10)
