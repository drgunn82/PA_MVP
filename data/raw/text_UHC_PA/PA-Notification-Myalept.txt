1. Background:
Myalept (metreleptin) is a leptin analog indicated as an adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to treat
the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized
lipodystrophy.
Limitations of Use:
The safety and effectiveness of Myalept for the treatment of complications of partial lipodystrophy or
for the treatment of liver disease, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), have not been
established. Myaept is not indicated for use in patients with HIV-related lipodystrophy or patients
with metabolic disease, without concurrent evidence of generalized lipodystrophy.
Due to the risks associated with the development of anti-metreleptin antibodies that neutralize
endogenous leptin and/or lymphoma, Myalept is only available through the Myalept Risk Evaluation
and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) restricted program.
