1. Background:
Strensiq® (asfotase alfa) is a tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase indicated for the treatment
of patients with perinatal/infantile and juvenile-onset hypophosphatasia (HPP).
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Therapy
1. Strensiq will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Diagnosis of perinatal/infantile or juvenile-onset hypophosphatasia based on all of
the following:
(1) One of the following:
a. Onset of clinical signs and symptoms of hypophosphatasia prior to age 18
years (e.g., respiratory insufficiency, vitamin B6 responsive seizures,
hypotonia, failure to thrive, delayed walking, waddling gait, dental
abnormalities, low trauma fractures)
b. Radiographic evidence supporting the diagnosis of hypophosphatasia at the
age of onset prior to age 18 (e.g., craniosynostosis, infantile rickets, non-
traumatic fractures)
-AND-
(2) One of the following:
a. Both of the following:
i. Patient has low level activity of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
evidenced by an ALP level below the age and gender-adjusted normal
range
ii. Patient has an elevated level of tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase
(TNSALP) substrate (e.g., serum pyridoxal 5’-phosphate [PLP] level,
serum or urine phosphoethanolamine [PEA] level, urinary inorganic
pyrophosphate [PPi level])

however please note that the provider should confirm coverage status of any new
genetic testing under the patient’s UnitedHealthcare plan prior to ordering.
