Program Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity
Medication Yorvipath® (palopegteriparatide)
P&T Approval Date 12/2024
Effective Date 3/1/2025
1. Background:
Yorvipath® is a parathyroid hormone analog (PTH(1-34)) indicated for the treatment of
hypoparathyroidism in adults.
Conventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism consists of active vitamin D (e.g., calcitriol or its
analog alfacalcidol) and calcium supplementation.
Limitations of Use:
• Yorvipath was not studied for acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism.
• Titration scheme was only evaluated in adults who first achieved an albumin-corrected serum
calcium of at least 7.8 mg/dL using calcium and active vitamin D treatment.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization
1. Yorvipath will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism
-AND-
b. Confirmation of initial diagnosis by both of the following:
(1) Pretreatment low albumin‐corrected serum calcium (i.e., ≤ 8.5 mg/dL)
confirmed on at least two occasions separated by at least 2 weeks
-AND-
(2) Pretreatment undetectable or inappropriately low intact parathyroid (PTH)
concentration (i.e., < 20 pg/mL), by second- or third-generation
immunoassay, on at least two occasions
-AND-
c. Yorvipath is not being used to treat acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism
-AND-

d. Patient is currently on adequate supplemental calcium and active vitamin D
(e.g., calcitriol) therapy as evidenced by both of the following:
(1) Albumin‐corrected serum calcium 7.8–10.6 mg/dL
(2) Serum 25(OH) vitamin D 20–80 ng/mL
-AND-
e. Prescribed by one of the following:
(1) Endocrinologist
(2) Nephrologist
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
B. Reauthorization
1. Yorvipath will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Documentation of positive clinical response [e.g., albumin-corrected serum
calcium level in normal range (approximately 8.3-10.6 mg/dL), independence
from conventional therapy (e.g., requiring no active vitamin D, ≤ 600 mg/day of
calcium)]
-AND-
b. Prescribed by one of the following:
(1) Endocrinologist
(2) Nephrologist
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific
benefit plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization
management programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-
authorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10)
and/or claim logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program
and/or therapeutic class.
