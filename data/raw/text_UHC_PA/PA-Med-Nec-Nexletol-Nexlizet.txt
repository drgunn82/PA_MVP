Program Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity
Medication Nexletol® (bempedoic acid), Nexlizet ® (bempedoic acid/ezetimibe)
P&T Approval Date 7/2020, 8/2021, 9/2022, 11/2023, 6/2024
Effective Date 9/1/2024
1. Background:
Nexletol (bempedoic acid) and Nexlizet (bempedoic acid/ezetimibe) are indicated as an adjunct to
diet and tother low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies, or alone when
concomitant LDL-C lowering therapy is not possible to reduce LDL-C in adults with primary
hyperlipidemia, including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), and to reduce the risk
of myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization in adults who are unable to take
recommended statin therapy (including those not taking a statin) with established cardiovascular
disease (CVD) or a high risk for a CVD event but without established CVD
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Hyperlipidemia
1. Initial Authorization
a. Nexletol and Nexlizet will be approved based on all the following criteria:
(1) One of the following diagnoses:
(a) Primary hyperlipidemia, including heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)
(b) Established cardiovascular disease (CVD) as documented by one of the
following:
(i) coronary artery disease
(ii) symptomatic peripheral arterial disease
(iii) cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease
(c) High risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) as documented by one of the
following:
(i) diabetes and over 60 years old
(ii) Reynolds risk score greater than 30%
(iii) coronary artery calcium score greater than 400 Agatston units
(iv) ASCVD risk score greater than or equal to 20% with the American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) risk

continue to receive a low-intensity or moderate-intensity statin at
maximally tolerated dose
-OR-
(c) Patient is unable to tolerate low or moderate-, and high-intensity statins as
evidenced by one of the following:
i. One of the following intolerable and persistent (i.e. more than 2 weeks)
symptoms for low or moderate-, and high-intensity statins:
