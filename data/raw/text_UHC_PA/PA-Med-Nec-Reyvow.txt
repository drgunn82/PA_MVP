1. Background:
Reyvow (lasmiditan) is a serotonin 5-HT receptor agonist indicated for the acute treatment of
1F
migraine with or without aura in adults. Sedation was reported up to 8 hours after a single dose
of Reyvow. Patients should be advised to not engage in activities requiring complete mental
alertness, such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery, for at least 8 hours after each
dose of Reyvow.
The American Headache Society recommends use of NSAIDs (including aspirin), non-opioid
analgesics, acetaminophen, or caffeinated analgesic combinations (e.g.,
aspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine) for mild‐to‐moderate attacks and migraine‐specific agents
(i.e.,triptans, dihydroergotamine [DHE]) for moderate or severe attacks and mild‐to‐moderate
attacks that respond poorly to NSAIDs or caffeinated combinations.
This program requires a member to try lower cost options prior to receiving coverage for
Reyvow.
