Medication Rivfloza™ (nedosiran)
P&T Approval Date 3/2024, 4/2024, 5/2024, 5/5025
Effective Date 8/1/2025
1. Background:
Rivfloza™ (nedosiran) is an LDHA-directed small interfering RNA indicated to lower urinary
oxalate levels in children 2 years of age and older and adults with primary hyperoxaluria type
1 (PH1) and relatively preserved kidney function, e.g., eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization
1. Rivfloza will be approved based on one of the following criteria:
a. All of the following:
(1) Patient has been established on therapy with Rivfloza under an active
UnitedHealthcare medical benefit prior authorization for the treatment of
primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1)
-AND-
(2) Submission of medical records (e.g., chart notes, laboratory values)
documenting a positive clinical response to therapy from pre-treatment baseline
(e.g., decreased urinary oxalate concentrations, decreased urinary oxalate:
creatinine ratio, decreased plasma oxalate concentrations)
-AND-
(3) Patient has not received a liver transplant
-AND-
(4) Patient has relatively preserved kidney function (e.g., eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73
m2)
-AND-
(5) Patient is not receiving Rivfloza in combination with Oxlumo (lumasiran)
-AND-

(6) Prescribed by, or in consultation with, a specialist (e.g., geneticist, nephrologist,
urologist) with expertise in the treatment of PH1
-OR-
b. All of the following:
(1) Diagnosis of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1)
-AND-
(2) Confirmation of diagnosis based on both of the following:
(a) Metabolic testing demonstrating one of the following:
i. Increased urinary oxalate excretion (e.g. greater than 1 mmol/1.73 m2
per day [90 mg/1.73 m2 per day], increased urinary oxalate: creatinine
ratio relative to normative values for age)
-OR-
ii. Increased plasma oxalate and glyoxylate concentrations
-AND-
(b) Genetic testing has confirmed a mutation in the alanine: glyoxylate
aminotransferase (AGT or AGXT) gene
-AND-
(3) Patient has not received a liver transplant
-AND-
(4) Patient is at least 2 years of age and older
-AND-
(5) Patient has relatively preserved kidney function (e.g., eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73
m2)
-AND-
(6) Patient is not receiving Rivfloza in combination with Oxlumo (lumasiran)
-AND-
(7) Prescribed by, or in consultation with, a specialist (e.g., geneticist, nephrologist,

urologist) with expertise in the treatment of PH1
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
B. Reauthorization
1. Rivfloza will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Submission of medical records (e.g., chart notes, laboratory values) documenting a
positive clinical response to therapy from pre-treatment baseline (e.g., decreased
urinary oxalate concentrations, decreased urinary oxalate: creatinine ratio, decreased
plasma oxalate concentrations)
-AND-
b. Patient has not received a liver transplant
-AND-
c. Patient has relatively preserved kidney function (e.g., eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2)
-AND-
d. Patient is not receiving Rivfloza in combination with Oxlumo (lumasiran)
-AND-
e. Prescribed by, or in consultation with, a specialist (e.g., geneticist, nephrologist,
urologist) with expertise in the treatment of PH1
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific
benefit plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization
management programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-
authorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-
10) and/or claim logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by
program and/or therapeutic class.
