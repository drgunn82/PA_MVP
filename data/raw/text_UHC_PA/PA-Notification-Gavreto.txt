1. Background:
Gavreto (pralsetinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
metastatic rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC).
Gavreto is also indicated for adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with advanced or
metastatic RET fusion-positive thyroid cancer who require systemic therapy and who are
radioactive iodine-refractory (if radioactive iodine is appropriate). This indication is approved
under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response. Continued
approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit
in confirmatory trial(s). The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends
use of Gavreto in hepatobiliary cancers that is RET gene fusion positive.
Coverage Information:
Members will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage. For members under the age of 19
years, the prescription will automatically process without a coverage review.
Some states mandate benefit coverage for off-label use of medications for some diagnoses or under
