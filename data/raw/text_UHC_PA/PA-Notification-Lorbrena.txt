1. Background:
Lorbrena (lorlatinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
In addition, the National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) recommends Lorbrena for the
treatment of patients with ALK-positive recurrent and advanced NSCLC and in patients with
ROS1 rearrangement positive recurrent, advanced, or metastatic NSCLC.
The use of Lorbrena is also recommended by the NCCN for the treatment of Erdheim-Chester
Disease (ECD) with symptomatic or relapsed/refractory disease, treatment of advanced,
recurrent/metastatic, or inoperable uterine sarcoma, treatment of limited and extensive brain
metastases in patients with ALK rearrangement-positive NSCLC, treatment of inflammatory
myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) with ALK translocation, and treatment of relapsed or refractory
ALK-positive peripheral T-Cell and large B-Cell lymphoma.
