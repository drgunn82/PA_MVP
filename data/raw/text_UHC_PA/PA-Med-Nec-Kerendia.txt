1. Background:
Kerendia (finerenone) is indicated to reduce the risk of sustained estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) decline, end-stage kidney disease, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial
infarction, and hospitalization for heart failure in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD)
associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization
1. Kerendia will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D)
-AND-
b. Both of the following:
1) Urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) greater than equal to 30 mg/g
-AND-
2) An eGFR of greater than or equal to 25 mL/min/1.73 m2
-AND-
c. Used to reduce the risk of any of the following:
1) Sustained eGFR decline
2) End-stage kidney disease
3) Cardiovascular death
4) Non-fatal myocardial infarction
5) Hospitalization for heart failure
-AND-
d. Serum potassium level is less than or equal to 5 mEQ/L prior to initiating treatment
-AND-

e. One of the following:
1) Patient is on a stabilized dose and receiving concomitant therapy with one of the
following:
a) maximally tolerated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (e.g.,
captopril, enalapril)
b) maximally tolerated angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (e.g.,
candesartan, valsartan)
-OR-
2) Patient has an allergy, contraindication, or intolerance to ACE inhibitors and
ARB
-AND-
f. One of the following:
1) Patient is on a stabilized dose and receiving concomitant therapy with a SGLT2
inhibitor (e.g. Jardiance)
-OR-
2) History of failure, contraindication, or intolerance to a SGLT2 inhibitor (e.g.
Jardiance)
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
B. Reauthorization
1. Kerendia will be approved based on the following criterion:
a. Documentation of positive clinical response to therapy
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific benefit
plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization management
programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization
based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.
Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.
• Supply limits may be in place.

Program Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity – Kerendia
Change Control
Date Change
9/2021 New program
12/2021 Added a SGLT2 (Jardiance) as a step requirement. Updated references.
3/2022 Updated policy to change the reduction risk criteria from all to any and
updated potassium threshold from less than 5 mEq/L to less than or
equal to 5 mEq/L.
9/2022 Removed diabetic retinopathy and prescriber requirement. Updated
references.
12/2022 Based on updated guidelines modified UACR to greater than or equal to
30 mg/g and eGFR to greater than or equal to 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 for
diagnosis of chronic kidney disease and removed the eGFR bypass for
Jardiance since guidelines allow SGLT-2 inhibitors to an eGRF to 20
mL/min/1.73 m2. Increased the initial authorization to 6 months.
Updated references.
9/2023 Updated to allow concomitant therapy with a SGLT2.
10/2024 Updated diagnosis language. Updated references.
