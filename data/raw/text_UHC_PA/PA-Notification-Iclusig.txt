1. Background:
Iclusig (ponatinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with newly
diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (Ph+ ALL), in
combination with chemotherapy, as monotherapy in Ph+ ALL for whom no other kinase
inhibitors are indicated, or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL. Iclusig is also indicated in chronic phase
(CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with resistance or intolerance to at least two prior
kinase inhibitors, accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) CML for whom no other kinase
inhibitors are indicated, and T315I-positive CML (chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blast
phase).
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends Iclusig for the
treatment of myeloid, lymphoid, or mixed lineage neoplasms with eosinophilia and FGFR1 or
ABL1 rearrangements, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
