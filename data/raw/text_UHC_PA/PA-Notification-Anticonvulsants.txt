1. Background:
Aptiom (eslicarbazepine acetate), Briviact (brivaracetam), and Xcopri are indicated in the
treatment of partial-onset seizures.
Banzel (rufinamide), Onfi (clobazam), and Sympazan (clobazam) are indicated for the
adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). There is
some clinical evidence to support the use of clobazam for refractory partial onset seizures.
Diacomit (stiripentol) is indicated for seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients
taking clobazam.
Epidiolex (cannabadiol) is indicated for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,
Dravet syndrome or tuberous sclerosis complex.
Fintepla (fenfluramine) is indicated for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
and Dravet syndrome.
Fycompa (perampanel) is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without
secondarily generalized seizures and as adjunctive therapy for the treatment of primary
generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
Libervant (diazepam), Nayzilam (midazolam) and Valtoco (diazepam) are indicated for the acute
treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters,
acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern.
Sabril* (vigabatrin), Vigadrone (vigabatrin), Vigafyde (vigabatrin) and Vigpoder (vigabatrin) are
indicated for infantile spasms for whom the potential benefits outweigh the risk of vision loss.
Sabril, Vigadrone and Vigpoder are also indicated as adjunctive therapy for refractory complex
partial seizures in patients who have inadequately responded to several alternative treatments.
