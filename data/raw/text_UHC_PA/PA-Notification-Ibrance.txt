1. Background:
Ibrance® (palbociclib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-
positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic
breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine-based therapy, or in
combination with Faslodex® (fulvestrant) in patients with disease progression following
endocrine therapy.
The use of an aromatase inhibitor in men with breast cancer is ineffective without concomitant
suppression of testicular steroidogenesis. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
recommends the use of Ibrance as single-agent therapy for unresectable retroperitoneal well-
differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma (WD-DDLS).
