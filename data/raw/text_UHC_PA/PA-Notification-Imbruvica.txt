Imbruvica® (ibrutinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with the
following: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL); chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/SLL with 17p deletion; and Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia
(WM). Imbruvica is also FDA approved for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients age 1 year
and older with chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) after failure of one or more lines of
systemic therapy.1
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends the use of Imbruvica for
the B-cell lymphoma types: extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL) of the stomach and of
nongastric sites (noncutaneous), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), diffuse large B-cell, HIV-related B-
cell, high grade B-cell lymphoma, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. NCCN also
recommends its use for primary CNS lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia.2
