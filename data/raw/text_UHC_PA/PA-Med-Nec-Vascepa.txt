Program Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity
Medication Vascepa® (icosapent ethyl)*
P&T Approval Date 2/2020; 10/2020, 12/2020, 3/2021, 3/2022, 10/2023, 3/2024, 3/2025
Effective Date 6/1/2025
1. Background:
Vascepa (icosapent ethyl)* is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet and exercise to reduce
triglyceride (TG) levels in adult patients with severe (≥ 500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia.
Vascepa* is also indicated as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy to reduce the risk
of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and unstable angina requiring
hospitalization in adult patients with elevated triglyceride (TG) levels (≥ 150 mg/dL) and either
established cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus and 2 or more additional risk factors for
cardiovascular disease.
Since the Pharmacy & Therapeutics Committee has determined that use of Vascepa* is not
medically necessary for treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (TG≥ 500 mg/dL), coverage
of Vascepa* will only be provided for cardiovascular risk reduction after meeting these
requirements.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Cardiovascular Risk Reduction

a. Vascepa* will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
1) Diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia (pre-treatment triglyceride level ≥ 150 mg/dL)

2) Patient currently has or is considered high or very high risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) as evidenced by one of the following:
a) Both of the following:
i. Age ≥ 45
-AND-

1. Acute coronary syndrome
2. History of myocardial infarction

therapy (i.e. atorvastatin 40-80 mg, rosuvastatin 20-40 mg) and will continue to
receive a high-intensity statin at maximally tolerated dose
-OR-
b. Both of the following:
i. Patient is unable to tolerate high-intensity statin as evidenced by one of the
following intolerable and persistent (i.e. more than 2 weeks) symptoms:
