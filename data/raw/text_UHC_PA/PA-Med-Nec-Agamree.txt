Program Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity
Medication Agamree® (vamorolone)*
P&T Approval Date 10/1/2024
Effective Date 1/1/2025
1. Background:
Agamree (vamorolone)* is a corticosteroid indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (DMD) in patients 2 years of age and older.1
The UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee has determined that Agamree
is Therapeutically Equivalent to prednisone in the treatment of DMD. Data for FDA approval
from relatively short-term randomized controlled trials were limited; and while adverse effect
profiles may differ among glucocorticoids, vamorolone does not offer a clear advantage over
other glucocorticoids for DMD with respect to efficacy and overall safety.2-5
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
1. Published clinical evidence shows Agamree* is likely to produce equivalent therapeutic
results as other available corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone); therefore, Agamree is not
medically necessary for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific
benefit plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization
management programs may apply.
*Agamree is typically excluded from coverage. Tried/Failed criteria may be in place. Please
refer to plan specifics to determine exclusion status.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-
authorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-
10) and/or claim logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by
program and/or therapeutic class.
