1. Background:
Kisqali (ribociclib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with hormone
receptor (HR)- positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- negative advanced or
metastatic cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine-based therapy or
fulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine
therapy. Kisqali is also indicated for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the
adjuvant treatment of adults with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2)-negative stage II and III early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends the use of Kisqali similarly
for men and premenopausal women receiving ovarian ablation/suppression with recurrent
unresectable (local or regional) or metastatic HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer disease, in
combination with an aromatase inhibitor or Faslodex®(fulvestrant). The use of an aromatase
inhibitor in men with breast cancer is ineffective without concomitant suppression of testicular
steroidogenesis. The NCCN also recommends Kisqali for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive
recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma in combination with letrozole.
