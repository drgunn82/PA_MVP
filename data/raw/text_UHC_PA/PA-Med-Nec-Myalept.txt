1. Background:
Myalept (metreleptin) is a leptin analog indicated as an adjunct to diet as replacement therapy to
treat the complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital or acquired generalized
lipodystrophy.
Limitations of Use:
• The safety and effectiveness of Myalept for the treatment of complications of partial
lipodystrophy have not been established.
• The safety and effectiveness of Myalept for the treatment of liver disease, including nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH), have not been established.
• Myalept is not indicated for use in patients with HIV-related lipodystrophy.
• Myalept is not indicated for use in patients with metabolic disease, without concurrent evidence
of generalized lipodystrophy.
Myalept is available only through a restricted distribution program under a Risk Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategy (REMS), called the Myalept REMS program, because of the risks associated with
the development of anti-metreleptin antibodies that neutralize endogenous leptin and the risk of
lymphoma.
