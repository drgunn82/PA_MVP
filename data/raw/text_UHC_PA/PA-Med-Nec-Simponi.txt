1. Background:
Simponi (golimumab) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker, indicated for the treatment of adult
patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in combination with
methotrexate (MTX).1 Simponi, alone or in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the
treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).1 It is also indicated for the treatment of
adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS).1 Simponi is also indicated in adult patients
with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have demonstrated corticosteroid
dependence or who have had an inadequate response to or failed to tolerate oral aminosalicylates, oral
corticosteroids, azathioprine, or 6-mercaptopurine. For ulcerative colitis, it is indicated for inducing
and maintaining clinical response, improving endoscopic appearance of the mucosa during induction,
inducing clinical remission, and achieving and sustaining clinical remission in induction responders.1
An intravenous formulation of golimumab, Simponi Aria®, is also available. Simponi Aria® is
indicated for adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in combination
with methotrexate, active psoriatic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and older, adult patients with
active ankylosing spondylitis, and active polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pJIA) in patients
2 years of age and older.
