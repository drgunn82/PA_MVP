1. Background:
Tasigna® (nilotinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric
patients greater than or equal to 1 year of age with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome
positive chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph+ CML) in chronic phase, as well as treatment of adult
patients with chronic phase (CP) and accelerated phase Ph+ CML resistant to or intolerant to
prior therapy that included Gleevec® (imatinib).1 Tasigna is also indicated for treatment of
pediatric patients greater than or equal to 1 year of age with Ph+ CML-CP and CML-AP
resistant or intolerant to prior tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. The National Cancer
Comprehensive Network (NCCN) recommends the use of Tasigna for primary or follow-up
CML therapy in all stages. NCCN also recommends Tasigna for the treatment of the following:
progressive gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) when patient is no longer receiving benefit
from Gleevec® (imatinib), Stivarga® (regorafenib), Qinlock® (ripretinib), or Sutent® (sunitinib);
for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-
ALL); in cutaneous melanoma with activating mutations of KIT and/or projected risk of
progression with BRAF-targeted therapy; for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma of pigmented
villonodular synovitis/tenosynovial giant cell tumor; and for myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with
eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase fusion genes. 2
