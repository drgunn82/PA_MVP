1. Background:
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)1 recommends prophylactic ocular topical
medication for all newborns to prevent gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum (GON). GON can

Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is the only FDA approved drug for the prophylaxis of GON.
Ocular prophylaxis of newborns is mandated in most states and is considered standard neonatal
care.
This program is designed to meet Health Care Reform requirements which require coverage of
0.5% erythromycin ophthalmic ointment at zero dollar cost share if being used for primary
prevention of GON.
