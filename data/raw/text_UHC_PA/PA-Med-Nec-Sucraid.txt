1. Background:
Sucraid (sacrosidase) is an oral enzyme replacement therapy indicated for the treatment of sucrase
deficiency, which is part of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID). The effects of
Sucraid have not been evaluated in patients with secondary (acquired) sucrase deficiency.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization
1. Sucraid will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Submission of medical records documenting a diagnosis of congenital sucrase-
isomaltase deficiency (CSID)
-AND-
b. Submission of medical records documenting diagnosis has been confirmed by one of
the following:
(1) Endoscopic biopsy of the small bowel indicating all of the following:
(a) Normal small bowel morphology
-AND-
(b) Absent or markedly reduced sucrase activity
-AND-
(c) Isomaltase activity varying from 0 to full activity
-AND-
(d) Reduced maltase activity
-AND-
(e) One of the following:
i. Normal lactase activity

-OR-
ii. Both of the following:
• Reduced lactase
• Sucrase:lactase ratio of < 1.0
-OR-
(2) Molecular genetic testing of the sucrase-isomaltase (SI) gene indicating a
pathogenic isomaltase gene variant
-OR-
(3) Carbon-13 sucrose breath test (13C SBT) indicating a cumulative [13C] CO
2
exhalation over 90 minutes below 10th percentile (i.e., < 3.9% for men and < 5.2%
for women)
-AND-
c. Prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist or rare disease specialist
-AND-
d. Will be used with a sucrose-free, low starch diet
Authorization will be issued for 3 months.
B. Reauthorization
1. Sucraid will be approved based on all of the following criterion:
a. Documentation of positive clinical response Sucraid therapy [e.g., reduced symptoms
(e.g., abdominal pain, bloating, gas, vomiting), reduced number of stools per day,
reduced number of symptomatic days]
-AND-
b. Prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist or rare disease specialist
-AND-
