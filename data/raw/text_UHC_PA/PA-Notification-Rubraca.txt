1. Background:
Rubraca (rucaparib) is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor indicated for the
maintenance treatment of adult patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or
somatic)-associated recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who
are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.
Rubraca is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious BRCA mutation
(germline and/or somatic)-associated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who
have been treated with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy. This
indication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of
response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and
description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends Rubraca for castration-
resistant distant metastatic prostate cancer for patients who have a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutation (germline and/or somatic) and have been treated with androgen receptor-directed
therapy. The NCCN also recommends Rubraca as second-line therapy that may be considered for
BRCA altered uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS). The NCCN also recommends Rubraca as
maintenance therapy for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma in patients with germline or
somatic BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutations if good performance status (ECOG 0-1) and no disease
progression (after at least 4-6 months of chemotherapy, assuming acceptable tolerance) following
the most recent platinum-based chemotherapy.
