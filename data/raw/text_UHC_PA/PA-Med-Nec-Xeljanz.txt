1. Background:
Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR (tofacitinib) is an inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) indicated for the
treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have
had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
blockers. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other non-
biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).1 Examples of non-biologic
DMARDs commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis include methotrexate,
leflunomide, and sulfasalazine.2,3 Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR is also indicated for the treatment of
adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis, and moderately to
severely active ulcerative colitis, who have an inadequate response or intolerance to one or
more TNF blockers. Xeljanz/Xeljanz Oral Solution is indicated for the treatment of active
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and older who have had an
inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers.
Limitations of Use:
The use of Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR/Xeljanz Oral Solution in combination with biologic DMARDs or
with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.
