1. Background:
Forteo (teriparatide)* and Teriparatide Injection (teriparatide) are recombinant human parathyroid
hormone with three FDA approved indications1-2:
• Treatment of postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture
Forteo and Teriparatide Injection are indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with
osteoporosis who are at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture,
multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available
osteoporosis therapy.
• Increase of bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis at high risk for
fracture
Forteo and Teriparatide Injection are indicated to increase bone mass in patients with primary or
hypogonadal osteoporosis at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture,
multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available
osteoporosis therapy.
• Treatment of patients with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis at high risk for fracture
Forteo and Teriparatide Injection are indicated for the treatment of patients with osteoporosis
associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy (daily dosage equivalent to 5 mg or
greater of prednisone) at high risk for fracture, defined as a history of osteoporotic fracture,
multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available
osteoporosis therapy.
Forteo* and Teriparatide Injection for more than 2 years during a patient’s lifetime should only be
considered if a patient remains at or has returned to having a high risk for fracture.1-2
The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology
AACE/ACE) recommend the use of teriparatide be considered for patients unable to use oral therapy
and as initial therapy for patients at very high fracture risk defined as the following: patients with a
recent fracture (e.g., within the past 12 months), fractures while on approved osteoporosis therapy,
multiple fractures, fractures while on drugs causing skeletal harm (e.g., long-term glucocorticoids),
very low T-score (e.g., less than −3.0), high risk for falls or history of injurious falls, and very high
fracture probability by FRAX® (fracture risk assessment tool) (e.g., major osteoporosis fracture
>30%, hip fracture >4.5%) or other validated fracture risk algorithm to be at very high fracture risk.3
Additionally, the AACE/ACE and Endocrine Society both recommend to limit treatment with
teriparatide to 2 years.3-4
Coverage will be provided for members who meet the following criteria.
