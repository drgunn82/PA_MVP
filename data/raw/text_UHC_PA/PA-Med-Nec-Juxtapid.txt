1. Background:
Juxtapid (lomitapide) is a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor indicated as an
adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid lowering treatments, including LDL apheresis where
available, to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC),
apolipoprotein B (apo B), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) in patients
with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). The safety and efficacy of Juxtapid
have not been established in patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not have HoFH,
including those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). The effect of
Juxtapid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.
2. Coverage Criteriaa :
A. Initial Authorization
1. Juxtapid will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Diagnosis of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) as confirmed by one of
the following:
(1) Submission of medical records (e.g., chart notes, laboratory values) confirming
genetic confirmation of bi-allelic pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants on different
chromosomes at the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B
(APOB), proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9), or low-density
lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1 (LDLRAP1) genes or ≥ 2 such variants at
different loci
-OR-
(2) Both of the following:
(a) Untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) greater than 400 mg/dL
-AND-

a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific benefit
plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization management
programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization
