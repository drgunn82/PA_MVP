1. Background:
Promacta and Alvaiz (eltrombopag) are a thrombopoietin receptor agonists indicated for the
treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult and pediatric patients (1 year and older for Promacta and
6 years and older for Alvaiz) with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who
have experienced an insufficient response to corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy,
for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow the initiation
and maintenance of interferon-based therapy, and for the treatment of patients with severe
aplastic anemia who have had an insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy. Promacta
is also approved in combination with standard immunosuppressive therapy for the first line
treatment of adult and pediatric patients 2 years and older with severe aplastic anemia.
Promacta and Alvaiz should be used only in patients with ITP whose degree of
thrombocytopenia and clinical condition increase the risk for bleeding.
Promacta and Alvaiz should be used only in patients with chronic hepatitis C whose degree of
thrombocytopenia prevents the initiation of interferon-based therapy or limits the ability to
maintain interferon-based therapy. Safety and efficacy have not been established in combination
with direct-acting antiviral agents used without interferon for treatment of chronic hepatitis C
infection.
