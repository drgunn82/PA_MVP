1. Background:
Northera (droxidopa)* is indicated for the treatment of orthostatic dizziness, lightheadedness,
or the “feeling that you are about to black out” in adult patients with symptomatic neurogenic
orthostatic hypotension (nOH) caused by primary autonomic failure (Parkinson’s disease [PD],
multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure), dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency,
and non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Effectiveness beyond two weeks of treatment has not
been established. The continued effectiveness of Northera* should be assessed periodically.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization
1. Northera* will be approved based on all of the following criteria
a. Diagnosis of symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nOH) as defined by one
of the following when an upright position is assumed or when using a head-up tilt-table
testing at an angle of at least 60 degrees:
(1) At least a 20 mm Hg fall in systolic pressure
(2) At least a 10 mm Hg fall in diastolic pressure
-AND-
b. nOH caused by one of the following:
(1) Primary autonomic failure (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, and
pure autonomic failure)
(2) Dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency
(3) Non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy
-AND-
c. Diagnostic evaluation has excluded other causes associated with orthostatic
hypotension (e.g., congestive heart failure, fluid restriction, malignancy)
-AND-
d. The patient has tried at least two of the following non-pharmacologic interventions:

(nitrates), alpha-adrenergic antagonists, and antidepressants]
(2) Raising the head of the bed 10 to 20 degrees
(3) Compression garments to the lower extremities or abdomen
(4) Physical maneuvers to improve venous return (e.g., regular modest-intensity
exercise)
(5) Increased salt and water intake, if appropriate
(6) Avoiding precipitating factors (e.g., overexertion in hot weather, arising too
quickly from supine to sitting or standing)
-AND-
e. No previous diagnosis of supine hypertension
-AND-
f. Prescribed by or in consultation with one of the following specialists:
(1) Cardiologist
(2) Neurologist
(3) Nephrologist
-AND-
g. History of failure (after a trial of at least 30 days), contraindication or intolerance to
both of the following medications:
(1) fludrocortisone (generic Florinef)
(2 midodrine (generic ProAmatine)
Authorization will be issued for 12 months.
B. Reauthorization
1. Northera* will be approved based on the following criteria:
a. Documentation of positive clinical response to Northera* therapy
-AND-
b. Physiological countermeasures for nOH continue to be employed
