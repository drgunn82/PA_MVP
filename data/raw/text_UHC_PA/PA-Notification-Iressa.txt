receptor (EGFR) exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations.1 The National
Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends the use of Iressa in patients with
NSCLC with EGFR S768I, L861Q, and/or G719X mutation positive tumors as well as patients
with NSCLC with a known sensitizing EGFR mutation and associated brain metastases.2
