1. Background:
Regranex is indicated for the treatment of lower extremity diabetic neuropathic ulcers that
extend into the subcutaneous tissue, or beyond, and have an adequate blood supply. Regranex
should be used as an adjunct to, and not a substitute for, good ulcer care practices including
initial sharp debridement, pressure relief and infection control. The efficacy of Regranex gel has
not been established for the treatment of pressure ulcers or venous stasis ulcers. If a member has
a prescription for a diabetic medication within the last 180 days of claim’s history, the
prescription for Regranex will automatically process.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Authorization
1. Regranex will be approved based on both of the following criteria:
a. Patient has a lower extremity diabetic neuropathic ulcer
-AND-
b. Treatment will be given in combination with ulcer wound care (e.g., debridement,
infection control and/or pressure relief)
Authorization will be issued for 6 months
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific benefit
plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization management
programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Programs:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization
based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.
Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.
• Supply limits may be in place.
