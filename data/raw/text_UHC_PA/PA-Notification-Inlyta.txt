1. Background:
Inlyta (axitinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of advanced renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) after failure of one prior systemic therapy. It is also indicated in
combination with either avelumab or pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of patients
with advanced RCC. The NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) recommends the
use of Inlyta for treatment of unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent salivary gland tumors and
follicular, oncocytic, and papillary carcinomas. The NCCN also recommends Inlyta as
preferred therapy in combination with pembrolizumab for treatment of alveolar soft part
sarcoma (ASPS) and as first-line treatment of relapsed or stage IV renal cell carcinoma.
