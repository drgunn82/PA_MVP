Medication *Promacta® (eltrombopag) for oral suspension
*This program applies to the formulation for oral suspension
P&T Approval Date 8/2024
Effective Date 1/1/2025
1. Background:
Promacta (eltrombopag) is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of
thrombocytopenia in adult and pediatric patients 1 year and older with persistent or chronic
immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have experienced an insufficient response to
corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. Promacta is indicated for the treatment of
thrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow the initiation and maintenance of
interferon-based therapy. Promacta is also approved in combination with standard
immunosuppressive therapy for the first line treatment of adult and pediatric patients 2 years and
older with severe aplastic anemia and for the treatment of patients with severe aplastic anemia
who have had an insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy.
Promacta should be used only in patients with ITP whose degree of thrombocytopenia and
clinical condition increase the risk for bleeding.
Promacta should be used only in patients with chronic hepatitis C whose degree of
thrombocytopenia prevents the initiation of interferon-based therapy or limits the ability to
maintain interferon-based therapy. Safety and efficacy have not been established in
combination with direct-acting antiviral agents used without interferon for treatment of
chronic hepatitis C infection.
