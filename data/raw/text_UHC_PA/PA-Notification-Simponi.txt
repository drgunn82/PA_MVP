1. Background:
Simponi (golimumab) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker, indicated for the treatment of
adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in combination with
methotrexate (MTX).1 Simponi, alone or in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the
treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA).1 It is also indicated for the
treatment of adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS).1 Simponi is also indicated
in adult patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who have require continuous steroid
therapy or who have had an inadequate response to or intolerance to prior treatment. For
ulcerative colitis, it is indicated for inducing and maintaining clinical response, improving
endoscopic appearance of the mucosa during induction, inducing clinical remission, and
achieving and sustaining clinical remission in induction responders.1 An intravenous
formulation of golimumab, Simponi Aria®, is also available. Simponi Aria® is indicated for
adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis, active
psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis, and active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic
arthritis.
