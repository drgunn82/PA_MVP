1. Background:
Praluent® (alirocumab) is a PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin Type 9) inhibitor
indicated1:
• To reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and unstable angina requiring
hospitalization in adults with established cardiovascular disease.
• As adjunct to diet, alone or in combination with other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C)-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis), for the treatment of
adults with primary hyperlipidemia (including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia)
to reduce LDL-C.
• As an adjunct to other LDL-C-lowering therapies in adult patients with homozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) to reduce LDL-C.
• As an adjunct to diet and other LDL-C-lowering therapies in pediatric patients aged 8 years
and older with HeFH to reduce LDL-C.
