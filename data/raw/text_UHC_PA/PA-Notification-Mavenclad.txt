1. Background:
Mavenclad® (cladribine) is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis
(MS), to include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease, in adults.
Because of its safety profile, the use of Mavenclad is generally recommended for patients who
have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the
treatment of MS. Mavenclad is not recommended for use in patients with clinically isolated
syndrome (CIS) because of its safety profile.1
The recommended cumulative dosage of Mavenclad is divided into 2 yearly treatment courses.
Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles with the 2nd cycle administered 23-27
days after the last dose of the 1st cycle. Additional cycles of Mavenclad are not to be
administered after the completion of the 2nd treatment course. The safety and efficacy of
reinitiating Mavenclad more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been
studied.
