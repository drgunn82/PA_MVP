1. Background:
Alecensa (alectinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as
detected by an FDA-approved test and for adjuvant treatment in adult patients following tumor
resection of ALK-positive NSCLC (tumors ≥ 4 cm or node positive) as detected by an FDA-
approved test. The NCCN also recommends Alecensa for ALK-fusion
targeted relapsed/refractory, symptomatic Erdheim-Chester Disease, as second-line or initial
palliative intent therapy and subsequent therapy for relapsed/refractory ALK+ anaplastic large
cell lymphoma (ALCL), relapsed or refractory ALK-positive large B-Cell lymphoma, ALK-
positive metastatic brain cancer from NSCLC, ALK-rearrangement positive pediatric diffuse
high-grade glioma, and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors with ALK translocation.
