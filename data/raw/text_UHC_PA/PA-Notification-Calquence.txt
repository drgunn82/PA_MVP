1. Background:
Calquence (acalabrutinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated:
• In combination with bendamustine and rituximab for the treatment of adult patients with
previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who are ineligible for autologous
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
• For the treatment of adult patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy.
• For the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small
lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends the use of Calquence for the
treatment of B-cell lymphomas, including splenic and nodal marginal zone lymphoma, extranodal
marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL) of the stomach, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of
nongastric sites (noncutaneous), and Waldenström macroglobulinemia/lymphoplasmacytic
lymphoma.
