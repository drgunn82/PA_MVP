Tazorac (tazarotene) 0.05% and 0.1% cream and gel are indicated for the topical treatment

plaque-psoriasis, topical corticosteroids and topical calcipotriene (Dovonex) are
recommended as initial therapy. For uncontrolled localized plaque-psoriasis anthralin

The use of a topical retinoid is recommended as monotherapy primarily in
noninflammatory acne, or in combination with topical or oral antimicrobials in patients
