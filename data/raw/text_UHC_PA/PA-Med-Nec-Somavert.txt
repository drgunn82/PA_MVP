P&T Approval Date 7/2016, 7/2017, 7/2018, 7/2019, 7/2020, 7/2021, 7/2022, 7/2023, 7/2024
Effective Date 10/1/2024
1. Background:
Somavert (pegvisomant) is a growth hormone receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment
of acromegaly in patients who have had an inadequate response to surgery or radiation
therapy, or for whom these therapies are not appropriate. The goal of treatment is to
normalize serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels.1
The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) recommends pegvisomant in
patients for whom surgical treatment and somatostatin analogues (SSAs) have proved
ineffective or for those who are intolerant of SSAs.2 The AACE and the Endocrine Society
also recommend that dopamine agonists may be considered as first-line medical therapy,
particularly in patients with mild biochemical activity, such as in the setting of modestly
elevated serum IGF-I levels in the absence or concomitant presence of SSA therapy.2,3
