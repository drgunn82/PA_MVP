1. Background:
Abilify MyCite (aripiprazole tablet with sensor)* is a drug-device combination product
comprised of aripiprazole tablets embedded with a sensor intended to track drug ingestion.
Abilify MyCite is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and as
adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. Abilify MyCite has not been shown to
improve patient adherence and should not be used to track real-time ingestion during an
emergency as the detection may be delayed or may not occur.
2. Coverage Criteria:

(5) Tourette’s disorder
-AND-
b. Submission of medical records documenting the patient is currently prescribed
aripiprazole and tolerates the medication.
-AND-
c. Submission of medical records documenting the patient’s adherence to
aripiprazole is less than 80% within the past 6 months (medication adherence
percentage is defined as the number of pills absent in a given time period divided

threatening or potentially life-threatening symptoms, or has experienced a severe
worsening of symptoms leading to a hospitalization which was attributed to the
lack of adherence to aripiprazole.

patient adherence and attests that Abilify MyCite is medically necessary for the
patient to maintain compliance, avoid life-threatening worsening of symptoms,
