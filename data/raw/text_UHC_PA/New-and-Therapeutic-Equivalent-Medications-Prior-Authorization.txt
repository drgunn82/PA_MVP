1. Background:
UnitedHealthcare benefit documents define Therapeutically Equivalent as when
medications/products have essentially the same efficacy and adverse effect profile. This
determination is made by the UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T)
Committee and is not intended to imply therapeutic equivalence as defined by the FDA
Orange Book.
Benefit plan designs include a prior authorization for certain prescription medications if
they are Therapeutically Equivalent, defined as similar outcomes and adverse events, to a
covered medication or an over-the-counter medication. Some states, including Oxford
plans due to state mandates, may require a prior authorization for these medications
which will require history of failure, contraindication or intolerance to another product(s)
or an over-the-counter medication. For additional information on coverage please see the
Physician PDL posted to UHCProvider.com.
