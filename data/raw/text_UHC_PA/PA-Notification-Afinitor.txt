1. Background:
Afinitor (everolimus) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women
with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer in combination with
Aromasin® (exemestane) after failure of treatment with Femara® (letrozole) or Arimidex®
(anastrozole); in adults with progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (PNET) and
adults with progressive, well-differentiated, non-functional neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of
gastrointestinal (GI) or lung origin that are unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic; adults
with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of treatment with Sutent® (sunitinib) or
Nexavar® (sorafenib); adults with renal angiomyolipoma and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC),
not requiring immediate surgery; treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 1 year and older
with TSC who have subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) that requires therapeutic
intervention but cannot be curatively resected; and for the adjunctive treatment of adult and
pediatric patients aged 2 years and older with TSC-associated partial-onset seizures.1
Afinitor is not indicated for the treatment of patients with functional carcinoid tumors.
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends use of Afinitor in
invasive and inflammatory breast cancer, Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia /
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, neuroendocrine tumors, kidney cancer, soft tissue sarcomas,
osteosarcomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, thymomas and thymic carcinomas, Hodgkin
lymphoma, follicular, oncocytic, and papillary thyroid carcinomas, subependymal giant cell
astrocytoma (SEGA), meningioma, histiocytic neoplasms, and endometrial carcinoma.2
