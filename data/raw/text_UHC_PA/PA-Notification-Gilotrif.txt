1. Background:
Gilotrif® (afatinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the first-line treatment of patients with
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have non-resistant epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test. Gilotrif is also
indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic, squamous NSCLC progressing after
platinum-based chemotherapy.1 The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also
recommends the use of Gilotrif in patients with advanced non-nasopharyngeal head and neck
cancers with progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. Additionally, the NCCN
also recommends use of Gilotrif as a single-agent treatment for brain metastases in patients with
EGFR sensitizing mutation positive NSCLC.2
Limitations of Use: Safety and efficacy of Gilotrif were not established in patients whose tumors
have resistant EGFR mutations.
