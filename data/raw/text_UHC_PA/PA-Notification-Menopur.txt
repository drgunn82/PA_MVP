1. Background:
The body produces two types of gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing
hormone (LH), both of which play a role in fertility and human reproduction. After they are produced
by the pituitary gland, gonadotropins trigger production of other sex hormones which then promote
production of egg and sperm. Gonadotropins include hMG (human menopausal gonadotropin –
Menopur) and follicle stimulating hormone. Gonadotropins are used in the treatment of infertility, a
disease of the reproductive system defined as one of the following:
• inability to achieve a successful pregnancy due to an individual’s medical, sexual, or reproductive
history;
• failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse
when the female partner is less than 35 years;
• failure to achieve a pregnancy after 6 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse
when the female partner is 35 years or older
Menopur (menotropins) is indicated for the development of multiple follicles and pregnancy in
ovulatory women participating in an assisted reproductive technology (ART) program. hMG is
used for the treatment of ovulation induction in women with ovulatory dysfunction including
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who failed on clomiphene as well as for ovulation induction
in the setting of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. hMG is also used for induction of
spermatogenesis in men with primary and secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in whom
the cause of infertility is not due to primary testicular failure.
The clinically appropriate dosing for hMG agents when used in an ART cycle without an FSH
product is 450 IU/day or less for not more than 14 days of treatment. When used as part of a
mixed stimulation protocol (hMG + FSH) or when used alone for ovulation induction or ovarian
stimulation, the clinically appropriate maximum dosing for hMG agents is 225 IU/day and 150
IU/day, respectively. Exceeding this daily dose and duration of treatment has not been proven to
be efficacious in terms of pregnancy outcome.

a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific benefit
plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization management
programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Programs:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization
based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim
logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or
therapeutic class.
• Supply limits may be in place.
*Infertility is typically excluded from coverage for UnitedHealthcare. Please refer to member’s
specific benefits for coverage determination.
ǂ OptumHealth review only: Please refer to the Clinical Policy on Human Menopausal
Gonadotropin (hMG) Used in the Treatment of Infertility for state-specific requirements that may
apply.
§ OptumHealth review only: Subsequent authorizations will be reviewed according to the Infertility
Clinical Performance Guideline.
