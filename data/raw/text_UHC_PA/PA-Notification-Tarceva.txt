1. Background:
Tarceva® (erlotinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon
19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations receiving first-line, maintenance, or second or
greater line treatment after progression following at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.1 Tarceva
is also indicated as first-line treatment for locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic
cancer in combination with gemcitabine.1
In addition, the National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends Tarceva for the
treatments of chordoma, brain, leptomeningeal, and spine metastases originating from NSCLC,
relapsed or stage IV kidney cancer with non-clear cell histology, NSCLC with known sensitizing
EGFR mutations, and vulvar cancer.2
The safety and efficacy of Tarceva has not been established in patients with NSCLC whose tumors
have other EGFR mutations. Tarceva is not recommended for use in combination with platinum-
based chemotherapy.1
