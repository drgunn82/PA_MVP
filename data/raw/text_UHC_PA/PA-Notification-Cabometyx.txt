1. Background:
Cabometyx® (cabozantinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with
advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), patients with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment
in combination with Opdivo (nivolumab), patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
who have been previously treated with Nexavar® (sorafenib tosylate), and in adult and
pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic
differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) that has progressed following prior VEGFR-targeted
therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible.
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) recommends Cabometyx for the
treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with RET gene rearrangement and HCC
as a single agent for progressive disease. Cabometyx is also recommended in NCCN
guidelines for bone cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), kidney cancer, soft tissue
sarcoma, and endometrial carcinoma.
