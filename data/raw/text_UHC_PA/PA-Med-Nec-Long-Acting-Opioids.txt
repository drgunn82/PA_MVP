1. Background:
Long-acting opioid analgesics, fentanyl transdermal patch, hydromorphone extended-
release, hydrocodone extended-release capsules, Hysingla ER, methadone, morphine
sulfate controlled-release capsules, morphine sulfate sustained-release capsules, MS
Contin, Nucynta ER, OxyContin, oxymorphone extended-release, and Xtampza ER are
indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, around-the-
clock opioid is needed for an extended period of time and for which alternative treatment
options are not appropriate. They are not intended for use as an as needed analgesic.
Long-acting opioids are not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the
first 12-24 hours following surgery), or if the pain is mild, or not expected to persist for
an extended period of time. They are only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is
already receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be
moderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should
individualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate.

Long-acting opioids should not be used in treatment naïve patients. Physicians should
individualize treatment in every case, initiating therapy at the appropriate point along a
progression from non-opioid analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
and acetaminophen to opioids in a plan of pain management such as those outlined by the
World Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the
Federation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines, or the American Pain Society.
The CDC recommends the following best practices in the prescription of long-acting
opioids:
• Nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy are preferred for
chronic pain.
• Before starting opioid therapy, treatment goals should be established with patients
that include realistic goals for pain and function and should consider how therapy will
be discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. For some clinical contexts (e.g.,
headache or fibromyalgia), the expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to
outweigh the risks. Track pain and function at every visit (at least every 3 months)
using a brief, validated instrument. Continue opioid therapy only if there is clinically
meaningful improvement in pain and function that outweighs risks to patient safety.
• When starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe immediate-
release opioids instead of extended release/long-acting opioids.
• Document the daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) in mg/day from all
sources of opioids. Access the state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP)
data at treatment initiation and periodically during treatment.
• Caution should be used when opioids are prescribed with benzodiazepines
concurrently. Screen for past and current substance abuse and for severe depression,
anxiety, and PTSD prior to initiation.
• Benefits and risks of toxicology testing should be considered to assess for prescribed
and nonprescribed controlled substances.
• Avoid escalating doses above 50-90 mg/day MME unless sustained meaningful
improvement in pain and function is attained.
• Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued therapy at least every 3
months. If benefits do not outweigh harms, physicians should maximize other
therapies and work closely with the patients to gradually reduce or taper opioids.
Evaluation should include assessment of substance use disorder/opioid dependence.
Validated scales (such as the DAST-10) are available at www.drugabuse.gov.
