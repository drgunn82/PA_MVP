1. Background:
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that clinicians should prescribe the lowest
effective dosage when opioids are started. Clinicians should use caution when prescribing opioids
at any dosage and guidelines note that opioids are not first-line or routine therapy for chronic
pain.
This program allows members with a greater than 34 day supply plan at retail to receive more than a
one month supply of opioids up to plan allowance.
2. Coverage Criteria:
A. Greater than 34 day supply at retail will be approved based on BOTH of the following:
1. The member requires a greater than one month supply of opioid medications
2. Document the diagnosis associated with the need for pain management
Authorization will be issued for plans that allow a greater than 34 day supply at retail
up to the plan allowance of days supply for 12 months.
3. Additional Clinical Programs:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-
authorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10)
and/or claim logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program
and/or therapeutic class.
• Supply limits may be in place.
• Opioid Cumulative Dose Review may be in place.
• Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity may be in place.
• Prior Authorization/New to Therapy may be in place.
