1. Background:
Bosulif® (bosutinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 1
year of age and older with chronic phase Philadelphia-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph+
CML), newly diagnosed or resistant or intolerant to prior therapy. Bosulif is also indicated for the
treatment of adult patients with accelerated, or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to
prior therapy. 1
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends use of Bosulif in follow-up
therapy in CML after primary treatment with asciminib, imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib. NCCN also
recommends Bosulif as primary treatment of CML in accelerated phase as a single agent, in
combination with induction chemotherapy for lymphoid blast phase or myeloid blast phase, in
combination with steroids for CML in lymphoid blast phase if not a candidate for induction
chemotherapy, for CML in myeloid blast phase as a single agent if not a candidate for induction
chemotherapy, as maintenance therapy with consolidation chemotherapy for non-candidates for
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) in remission for BP-CML, for CML patients
that are post-transplant experiencing a cytogenic or molecular relapse, for Philadelphia-positive acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, and for treatment of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and
tyrosine kinase fusion genes.
