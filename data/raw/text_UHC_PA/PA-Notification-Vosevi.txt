1. Background:
Vosevi is a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleotide analog
NS5B polymerase inhibitor, velpatasvir, an HCV NS5A inhibitor, and voxilaprevir, an HCV
NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic HCV

containing an NS5A inhibitor.
• Genotype 1a or 3 infection and have previously been treated with an HCV regimen
containing sofosbuvir without an NS5A inhibitor.
