(diroximel fumarate) are indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis
(MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active
secondary progressive disease, in adults.
Gilenya® (fingolimod) is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsing forms of
multiple sclerosis, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and
active secondary progressive disease, in patients 10 years of age and older.6 Tascenso ODT™
(fingolimod) is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, to include
clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive
disease, in pediatric patients 10 years of age and older.16 Due to the risk of a decrease in heart
rate and/or atrioventricular conduction after the first dose of Gilenya, all patients should be
observed for signs and symptoms of bradycardia for at least 6 hours after their first dose.
First-dose monitoring should also be performed when restarting Gilenya after discontinuation
for more than 14 days and with dose increases. Novartis, the manufacturer of Gilenya,
provides a First-Dose Observation program at no cost to the patient through the GILENYA®
