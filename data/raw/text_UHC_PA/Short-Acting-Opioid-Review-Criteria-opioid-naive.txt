1. Background:
The Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that clinicians should prescribe the lowest
effective dosage when opioids are started. Clinicians should use caution when prescribing
opioids at any dosage, should carefully reassess evidence of individual benefits and risks when
considering increasing dosage to 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) or more per day,
and should avoid increasing dosage to 90 MME or more per day or carefully justify a decision to
titrate dosage to 90 MME or more per day.
Patients new to opioid therapy will be limited to a 7-day supply* and less than 50 MME per day.
Opioid naïve members are defined as not having filled an opioid in the past 120 days.
2. Coverage Criteria a:
A. Short-Acting Opioids

(1) Diagnosis of cancer, end of life pain (including hospice care), palliative care or
sickle cell anemia
(2) Patient is currently at or exceeding 50 MME and prescriber attests patient has
been on an opioid in the past 120 days
(3) Document all of the following:
i. The diagnosis associated with the need for pain management with opioids.

assessment of increased risk for respiratory depression.
iii. The prescriber has acknowledged that they have completed an addiction risk
and risk of overdose assessment.
iv. Prescriber attests the member requires more than 50 MME per day to
adequately control pain. (please note initial fill will be limited to 90 MME)
-AND-
c. Request does not exceed four grams of acetaminophen per day.
Authorization for cancer, end of life pain or palliative care pain or sickle cell
anemia will be issued or a quantity of 9999 for 24 months to prevent further
disruption in therapy if the patient’s dose is increased. Members new to plan
(coverage effective date of <120 days) will be approved for one month for the
requested MME not to exceed the plan’s supply limit. All other approvals will be
issued for one month for the requested MME not to exceed the maximum labeled
FDA dosing where a maximum exists, the plan’s supply limit OR 90 MME.
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific
benefit plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization
management programs may apply.
* Patients age 19 years and under new to opioid therapy are restricted to a 3-day supply for initial fill.
Members age 20 years and older new to opioid therapy are restricted to up to a 7-day supply for initial
