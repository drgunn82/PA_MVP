system), and Nicotrol NS® (nicotine nasal spray)
P&T Approval Date 2/2018, 9/2018, 5/2019, 5/2020, 8/2021, 9/2022, 11/2023, 3/2025

1. Background:
Tobacco cessation therapies are more likely to be successful for patients who are motivated to stop
tobacco use and who are provided additional advice and support. Patients should be provided with
appropriate educational materials and counseling to support the quit attempt. The patient should
set a quit date.
This program is designed to meet Health Care Reform requirements and New Jersey state
mandates for tobacco cessation coverage at zero dollar cost share. New Jersey prohibits utilization
management for the first 180 days per plan year. Once a member has received coverage for 180
days of tobacco cessation therapy per plan year, including any combination of products, coverage
of continued therapy will be required to meet the below coverage criteria.
Coverage for continuation of Varenicline (generic Chantix) will bypass step therapy requirement if
the member is currently on therapy without having undergone utilization management review.
