Medication Fabhalta® (iptacopan)
P&T Approval Date 2/2024, 4/2024, 10/2024, 5/2025
Effective Date 8/1/2025
A. Background
Fabhalta (iptacopan) is a complement factor B inhibitor, indicated for the treatment of adults
with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH); the reduction of proteinuria in adults with
primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) at risk of rapid disease progression, generally
a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥1.5 g/g; and for the treatment of adults with
complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G), to reduce proteinuria.1
