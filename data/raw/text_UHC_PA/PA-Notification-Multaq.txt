1. Background:
Multaq is an antiarrhythmic drug indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for atrial
fibrillation in patients in sinus rhythm with a history of paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation.
Multaq carries a black box warning for increased risk of death, stroke, and heart failure in patients
with decompensated heart failure or permanent atrial fibrillation. It is contraindicated in patients
with symptomatic heart failure with recent decompensation requiring hospitalization or NYHA
Class IV heart failure, as Multaq doubles the risk of death in these patients. Multaq is also
contraindicated in patients in atrial fibrillation who will not or cannot be cardioverted into normal
sinus rhythm. In patients with permanent atrial fibrillation, Multaq doubles the risk of death,
stroke and hospitalization for heart failure.
Patients currently on Multaq therapy will be allowed to remain on therapy.
