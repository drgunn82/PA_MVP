1. Background:
Somatropin (Genotropin®*, Humatrope®*, Norditropin®, Nutropin AQ NuSpin®*, Omnitrope®,
Saizen®*, Zomacton®*) is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients with growth failure due to
inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (GH), growth hormone deficiency (GHD), short
stature associated with Turner syndrome or Noonan syndrome, idiopathic short stature (ISS), short-
stature or growth failure in short stature homeobox-containing gene homeobox (SHOX) gene
deficiency, growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome, short stature in children born small for
gestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth by 2 years to 4 years of age, and chronic kidney
disease (CKD) up to the time of renal transplantation., growth failure in children with chronic renal
insufficiency up to the time of transplant, short bowel syndrome in patients receiving specialized
nutritional support, and HIV-associated wasting. Somatropin is also indicated for replacement of
endogenous growth hormone (GH) in adults with confirmed GH deficiency (GHD).
Ngenla™ (somatrogon-ghla), is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 3 years and
older who have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous GH.
Skytrofa™ (lonapegsomatropin-tcgd) is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year and
older who weigh at least 11.5 kg and have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of
endogenous GH.
Sogroya®*(somapacitan-beco) is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 2.5 years
and older who have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous GD. It is also
indicated for the replacement of endogenous GD in adults with GHD.
Serostim® (somatropin) is indicated for the treatment of HIV patients with wasting or cachexia to
increase lean body mass and body weight and improve physical endurance.
Zorbtive® (somatropin) is indicated for the treatment of short bowel syndrome in adult patients
receiving specialized nutritional support.
Increlex® (mecasermin) is indicated for the treatment of growth failure in pediatric patients 2 years
of age and older with severe primary insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) deficiency or with GH
gene deletion who have developed neutralizing antibodies to GH.

Coverage Information
Since short stature in the absence of defined pathology is not a sickness or injury, growth hormone is
not a covered health service for these indications. The standard UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy Rider
explicitly excludes coverage of growth hormone for short stature caused by heredity and not by a
diagnosed medical condition.
Coverage for somatropin (Genotropin*, Humatrope*, Norditropin, Nutropin AQ NuSpin*,
Omnitrope, Saizen*, Serostim, Zomacton, Zorbtive), Ngenla, Skytrofa, Sogroya*, and Increlex will

*Genotropin, Humatrope, Nutropin, Saizen, Sogroya, and Zomacton are typically excluded from
coverage. Tried/Failed criteria may be in place. Please refer to plan specifics to determine exclusion
status.
Essential versus Nonessential Use
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010 includes a mandate that prohibits
annual dollar maximum limits for “essential” benefits. A strict definition of “essential” was not provided
in PPACA or in federal health care regulations published as of the date this program was revised.
UnitedHealthcare defines an “essential” use of growth hormone as therapy to treat a deficiency as part of
chronic disease management. Other uses such as replacement therapy in a disorder where a deficiency is
not noted are considered “nonessential.”
This information applies to groups with benefit caps in place for growth hormone therapy. If the diagnosis
is considered an essential use of the medication, the cap will not apply. For these cases, an override for
the cap amount will be entered at the same time the authorization (if criteria met) is entered for the
medication. If the diagnosis is a nonessential use of the medication, then only the authorization for the
medication will be entered.
Diagnosis
Pediatric growth hormone deficiency Essential
Growth failure in children small for gestational age Nonessential
Growth failure due to chronic renal insufficiency Nonessential
Growth failure due to Turner Syndrome Nonessential
© 2025 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.
25
Growth failure due to Noonan Syndrome Nonessential
Growth failure due to short-stature homeobox (SHOX) Nonessential
gene deficiency
Prader-Willi Syndrome Nonessential
Adult growth hormone deficiency Essential
Transition phase adolescent patients Essential
HIV-associated wasting syndrome/cachexia Essential
Short bowel syndrome Essential
Severe primary IGF-1 deficiency Essential
Idiopathic short stature (not currently covered per Nonessential
criteria)
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-
authorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10)
and/or claim logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program
and/or therapeutic class.
• Supply limits may be in place.
