1. Background:
Mekinist® (trametinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated as a single agent or in combination with
Tafinlar® (dabrafenib) for treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with
BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test. It is also
indicated in combination with Tafinlar for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) with BRAF V600E mutation as detected by an FDA approved test, for the adjuvant
treatment of melanoma with BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutations, as detected by an FDA-
approved test, involving the lymph nodes following resection, for the treatment of locally
advanced or metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer with BRAF V600E mutation with no satisfactory
locoregional treatment options, and for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age
and older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have
progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. The
latter indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and
duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification
and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). Mekinist, in combination with
Tafinlar, is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with low-
grade glioma (LGG) with a BRAF V600E mutation who require systemic therapy.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends use of Mekinist in
combination with Tafinlar for the adjuvant treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer with BRAF
V600E mutations following resection; for the treatment of follicular, oncocytic, and papillary
thyroid carcinomas with a BRAF mutation; for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS)
cancer in patients with melanoma or infiltrative supratentorial astrocytoma/oligodendroglioma;
distant metastatic uveal melanoma; epithelial ovarian cancer/fallopian tube cancer/primary
peritoneal cancer with persistent disease, recurrence in BRAF V600E positive tumors, or
recurrence of low-grade serous carcinoma; pancreatic and ampullary adenocarcinomas if BRAF
V600E mutation positive; BRAF V600E mutation positive histiocytic neoplasms and
hepatobiliary cancers; hairy cell leukemia; salivary gland tumor; and gastrointestinal stromal
tumor.
Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of BRAFV600 mutations in melanoma
