1. Background:
Lenvima (lenvatinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with locally
recurrent or metastatic, progressive, radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer,
in combination with Afinitor (everolimus), for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) following one prior anti-angiogenic therapy, in combination with Keytruda
(pembrolizumab), for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC, for the first-line
treatment of patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma, and in combination with
pembrolizumab, for the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma that is not
microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (pMMR), who have disease
progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and are not candidates for curative
surgery or radiation.
In addition, the National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends Lenvima for
the treatment of medullary thyroid carcinoma in patients who have experienced disease
progression while on Caprelsa (vandetanib) or Cometriq (cabozantinib), as a systemic therapy for
recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma, and for the treatment of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma,
thymic carcinoma, and cutaneous melanoma.
