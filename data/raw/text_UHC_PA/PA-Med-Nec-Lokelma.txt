1. Background:
Lokelma and Veltassa are indicated for the treatment of hyperkalemia. Lokelma and
Veltassa should not be used as an emergency treatment for life threatening hyperkalemia
because of its delayed onset of action. Non-emergent hyperkalemia is generally treated by
addressing the reversible causes, such as removing drugs that may be causing impaired
renal function, removing or adjusting medications that directly cause hyperkalemia, and
initiating therapies for potassium removal.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization
1. Lokelma and Veltassa will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
a. Diagnosis of non-life threatening hyperkalemia
b. Where clinically appropriate, loop or thiazide diuretic therapy for potassium
removal has failed
c. Patient follows a low potassium diet (less than or equal to 3 grams per day)
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
B. Reauthorization
1. Lokelma or Veltassa will be approved based on both of the following criteria:
a. Patient has a positive clinical response to Lokelma or Veltassa therapy and
continues to require treatment for hyperkalemia
b. Patient follows a low potassium diet (less than or equal to 3 grams per day)
Authorization will be issued for 12 months.
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific
benefit plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization
management programs may apply.
