Program Prior Authorization/Notification
Medication Sandostatin® (octreotide acetate)
Note: Only the subcutaneous formulation of octreotide requires
notification. Sandostatin LAR is covered under the medical benefit and
therefore addressed in the Somatostatin Analogs drug policy.

1. Background:
Sandostatin (octreotide acetate) is indicated to reduce blood levels of growth hormone and IGF-I
(somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated
with surgical resection, pituitary irradiation and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated
doses. It is also indicated for the symptomatic treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid
tumors where it suppresses or inhibits the severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with
the disease and for the treatment of profuse watery diarrhea associated with vasoactive intestinal
peptide (VIP)-secreting tumors.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends the use of octreotide acetate
for the treatment of thyomas and thymic carcinomas as well as meningiomas. The NCCN also
recommends octreotide acetate for the treatment of several types of neuroendocrine and adrenal
tumors, including neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, lung and thymus,
neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas, well-differentiated Grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors, and
pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. The NCCN Palliative Care Guidelines recommend octreotide
for the treatment of chemotherapy and/or radiation-induced diarrhea and malignant bowel
obstruction.
Clinical evidence supports the use of octreotide acetate as an adjunct to endoscopic therapy for
bleeding gastroesophageal varices associated with liver disease.
Coverage Information:
Some states mandate benefit coverage for off-label use of medications for some diagnoses or under
some circumstances. Some states also mandate usage of other Compendium references. Where such
mandates apply, they supersede language in the benefit document or in the notification criteria.
