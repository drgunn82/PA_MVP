1. Background:
Cholbam (cholic acid) is a bile acid indicated for the treatment of bile acid synthesis disorders due to
single enzyme defects (SEDs) and as an adjunctive treatment of peroxisomal disorders (PDs)
including Zellweger spectrum disorders in patients who exhibit manifestations of liver disease,
steatorrhea or complications from decreased fat-soluble vitamin absorption.
Cholbam should be discontinued if liver function does not improve within 3 months of starting
treatment, if complete biliary obstruction develops, or if there are persistent clinical or laboratory
indicators of worsening liver function or cholestasis.

disorders due to SEDs or PDs including Zellweger spectrum disorders have not been established.
