1. Background:
Kisqali® Femara® Co-Pack is a co-packaged product containing ribociclib, a kinase inhibitor,
and letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, and is indicated as initial endocrine-based therapy for the
treatment of adult patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Kisqali is also
indicated for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the adjuvant treatment of
adults with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(HER2)-negative stage II and III early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends the use of Kisqali
similarly for men and premenopausal women receiving ovarian ablation/suppression with
recurrent unresectable (local or regional) or metastatic HR-positive HER2-negative breast
cancer disease in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant. The use of an
aromatase inhibitor in men with breast cancer is ineffective without concomitant suppression of
testicular steroidogenesis. The NCCN also recommends Kisqali for estrogen receptor (ER)-
positive recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma in combination with letrozole.
