1. Background:
Brukinsa (zanubrutinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with mantle
cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy, relapsed or refractory
marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one anti-CD20-based regimen, and
relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL), in combination with obinutuzumab, after two or
more lines of systemic therapy. These indications are approved under accelerated approval based
on overall response rate. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon
verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial. Brukinsa is also indicated
for the treatment of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).
NCCN recommends Brukinsa for relapsed/refractory hairy cell leukemia and as second-line and
subsequent therapy for extranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL) of the stomach, extranodal
marginal zone lymphoma of nongastric sites (noncutaneous), nodal marginal zone, and splenic
marginal zone lymphomas.
