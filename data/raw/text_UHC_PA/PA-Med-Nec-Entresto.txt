1. Background:
Entresto (valsartan-sacubitril) is indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and
hospitalization for heart failure. Benefits are most clearly evident in patients with left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) below normal. It is also indicated for the treatment of symptomatic
heart failure with systemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction in pediatric patients aged one year
and older.
2. Coverage Criteria a:
A. Initial Therapy
1. Entresto will be approved based on one of the following criteria:
a. As continuation of therapy initiated during an inpatient stay
-OR-
b. Both of the following:
(1) Diagnosis of pediatric heart failure with systemic left ventricular systolic
dysfunction which is symptomatic.
(2) Prescribed by or in consultation with a cardiologist.
-OR-
c. All of the following:
(1) Diagnosis of heart failure (with or without hypertension)
-AND-
(2) One of the following:
(a) Ejection fraction is less than or equal to 40 percent
-OR-
(b) Both of the following:

ii. Patient has structural heart disease (i.e. left atrial enlargement (LAE) or
left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)
-AND-
(3) Heart failure is classified as one of the following:
(a) New York Heart Association Class II
(b) New York Heart Association Class III
(c) New York Heart Association Class IV
-AND-
(4) Patient does not have a history of angioedema
-AND-
(5) Patient will discontinue any use of concomitant ACE Inhibitor or ARB
before initiating treatment with Entresto. ACE inhibitors must be
discontinued at least 36 hours prior to initiation of Entresto
-AND-
(6) Patient is not concomitantly on aliskiren therapy
-AND-
(7) Entresto is prescribed by or in consultation with a cardiologist
Authorization will be issued for 12 months
B. Reauthorization
1. Entresto will be approved based on both of the following criteria:
a. The Entresto dose has been titrated to a dose of 97 mg/103 mg twice daily or the
maximum labeled dose for pediatric patients, or to a maximum dose as tolerated by
the patient
-AND-
b. Documentation of positive clinical response to therapy
