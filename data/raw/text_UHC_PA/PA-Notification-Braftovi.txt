1. Background:
Braftovi® (encorafenib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated, in combination with Mektovi™
(binimetinib), for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a
BRAF V600E or V600K mutation.
Braftovi, in combination with Erbitux® (cetuximab) and mFOLFOX6 (fluorouracil, leucovorin,
and oxaliplatin), is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
(CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation. Braftovi, in combination with Erbitux® (cetuximab), is
indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRC with a BRAF V600E mutation after
prior therapy. The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) Compendium
recommends the use of Braftovi, in combination with Erbitux or Vectibix (panitumumab), in
patients with metastatic or advanced colorectal cancer with a BRAF V600E mutation.
Braftovi, in combination with Mektovi, is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600E mutation. The NCCN
Compendium also recommends the use of Braftovi, in combination with Mektovi for the
treatment of recurrent and advanced NSCLC with BRAF V600E mutation.
Limitations of Use
Braftovi is not indicated for the treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF melanoma, wild-type
BRAF CRC, or wild-type BRAF NSCLC.
