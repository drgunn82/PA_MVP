1. Background:
Esbriet (pirfenidone) is a pyridone and Ofev (nintedanib) is a kinase inhibitor that are indicated
for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Ofev is also indicated for slowing the
rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial
lung disease (SSc-ILD) and for the treatment of chronic fibrosing interstitial lung diseases
(ILDs) with a progressive phenotype.
Members will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
1. Initial Authorization
a. Esbriet* and Ofev will be approved based on all of the following criteria:
(1) Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) as documented by all of the
following criteria:
(a) Exclusion of other known causes of interstitial lung disease (e.g., domestic
and occupational environmental exposures, connective tissue disease, and
drug toxicity), as documented by the following:
i. ICD-10 Code J84.112 (Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis)
-AND-
(b) One of the following:
i. In patients not subjected to surgical lung biopsy, the presence of a usual

-OR-
ii. In patients subjected to a lung biopsy, both HRCT and surgical lung
biopsy pattern reveal IPF or probable IPF5
