1. Background:
Koselugo is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 2 years of age and
older with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) who have symptomatic, inoperable plexiform
neurofibromas (PN).
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends Koselugo therapy in patients
as a single-agent treatment for recurrent or progressive NF-1 mutated glioma, or recurrent or
progressive circumscribed glioma with BRAF fusion or BRAF V600E activating mutation. NCCN
also recommends Koselugo therapy in patients with Langerhans cell histiocytic neoplasms that are
mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway mutation positive or when there is no detectable
mutation or testing available.
