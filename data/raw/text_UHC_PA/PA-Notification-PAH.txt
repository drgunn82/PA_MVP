1. Background:
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is often a progressive disease characterized by elevated
pressure in the vessels that carry blood between the heart and the lungs. This results in ventricular
dysfunction, reduced exercise capacity, the potential for right sided heart failure, and even death.
Several mechanisms have been identified in the pathogenesis of PAH, leading to the development of
five classes of medications to treat the disorder;endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs),
phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, prostacyclin analogs, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC)
stimulators, and an activin signaling ligand.
Letairis* (ambrisentan), Tracleer (bosentan), and Opsumit (macitentan) are oral endothelin receptor
antagonists (ERAs). Letairis is indicated for the treatment of PAH (WHO Group 1) to improve
exercise ability and delay clinical worsening. It is also indicated in combination with tadalafil to
reduce the risk of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening PAH, and to improve
exercise ability. 2 Tracleer is indicated for the treatment of PAH (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise
ability and to decrease clinical worsening in adult patients, and improve pulmonary vascular
resistance, which is expected to result in an improvement in exercise ability in pediatric patients aged
3 years and older.3 Opsumit is indicated for the treatment of PAH (WHO Group 1) to reduce the risks
of disease progression and hospitalization for PAH.8
Revatio* (sildenafil), Liqrev* (sildenafil), Alyq (tadalafil), Adcirca* (tadalafil), and Tadliq (tadalafil)
are oral PDE-5 inhibitors. Revatio* is indicated in pediatric patients 1 to 17 years old for the
treatment of PAH (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability and, in pediatric patients too young to
perform standardized exercise testing, pulmonary hemodynamics thought to underly improvements in
exercise.4 Revatio* and Liqrev* are indicated in adult patients for the treatment of PAH (WHO
Group 1) to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening.4,15 Adcirca*, Alyq, and Tadliq are
indicated for the treatment of PAH (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability.5, 13-14

Ventavis (iloprost), Tyvaso (treprostinil), and Tyvaso DPI (treprostinil) are prostacyclin analogs.
Ventavis is administered as an inhalation solution, Tyvaso is administered as an inhalation solution,
and Tyvaso DPI is administered as a dry powder inhaler. Ventavis is indicated for the treatment of
PAH (WHO Group 1) to improve a composite endpoint consisting of exercise tolerance, symptoms
(NYHA Class), and lack of deterioration.6 Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI are indicated for the treatment of
PAH (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability. Tyvaso and Tyvaso DPI are also indicated for the
treatment of pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (WHO Group 3) to
improve exercise ability.7,12
Orenitram (treprostinil) is an orally administered prostacyclin analog indicated for the treatment of
PAH (WHO Group 1) to delay disease progression and improve exercise capacity.9
Uptravi (selexipag) is a prostacyclin receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of PAH (WHO
Group 1) to delay disease progression and reduce the risk of hospitalization for PAH.11
Adempas (riociguat) is a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator indicated for the treatment of
adults with PAH (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise capacity, improve WHO functional class and
to delay clinical worsening. Adempas is also indicated for the treatment of adults with
persistent/recurrent chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) (WHO Group 4) after
surgical treatment or inoperable CTEPH to improve exercise capacity and WHO functional class.10
Opsynvi* (macitentan/tadalafil) is a combination of macitentan, an endothelin receptor antagonist
(ERA), and tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, indicated for chronic treatment of
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I) in adult patients of WHO functional class
(FC) II-III.16

a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific
benefit plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization
management programs may apply.
*Brand Adcirca, Letairis, Liqrev oral suspension, Opsynvi, and Revatio oral powder for suspension
are typically excluded from coverage. Tried/Failed criteria may be in place. Please refer to plan
specifics to determine exclusion status.
Additional Information regarding the endothelin receptor antagonists (Letairis*, Opsumit,
Opsynvi*, and Tracleer): These agents should be used with caution in patients with liver disease.

Use is not recommended in moderate to severe hepatic impairment. Tracleer product labeling
includes a black box warning regarding the risk of liver injury. Prescribers are cautioned to consider
whether benefits of use offset the risk of liver injury in WHO Class II patients. Early liver injury may
preclude future use as disease progresses. 3
Additional Information regarding the oral PDE-5 inhibitors (Adcirca*, Alyq, Liqrev*,
Opsynvi*, Revatio*, and Tadliq): Administration of the oral PDE-5 inhibitors to patients taking
any form of organic nitrate, either regularly or intermittently, is contraindicated.4,5, 13, 14 In addition, the
concomitant administration of oral PDE-5 inhibitors with Adempas is contraindicated.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization
based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.
Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.
• Supply limitations may be in place.
