1. Background:
Tukysa (tucatinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated in combination with trastuzumab and
capecitabine for treatment of adult patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, including patients with brain
metastases, who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic
setting. Tukysa is also indicated in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of adult
patients with RAS wild-type HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer that has
progressed following treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based
chemotherapy.
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) recommends the use of Tukysa for the
treatment of central nervous system cancers (limited and extensive brain metastases) when used in
combination with capecitabine and trastuzumab in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer if
previously treated with one or more anti-HER2-based regimens. The NCCN also recommends the
use of Tukysa in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of advanced or metastatic
colorectal cancer (HER2-amplified and RAS and BRAF wild-type) if intensive therapy not
recommended as well as in combination with trastuzumab as subsequent therapy for HER2-
positive unresectable, resected gross residual (R2), or metastatic biliary tract cancers.
