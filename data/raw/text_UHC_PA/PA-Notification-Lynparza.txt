1. Background:
Lynparza (olaparib) is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor indicated for the
maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic
BRCA-mutated (gBRCAm or sBRCAm) advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary
peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
Lynparza is also indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial
ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, who are in complete or partial response to
platinum-based chemotherapy. Lynparza is also indicated in combination with bevacizumab for the
maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy
and whose cancer is associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive status
defined by either: a deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA mutation or genomic instability.
Lynparza is also indicated in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm, human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative high risk early, recurrent, or metastatic breast
cancer who have been treated with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or, in the setting of
metastatic breast cancer, the metastatic setting. Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast
cancer should have been treated with a prior endocrine therapy or be considered inappropriate for
endocrine treatment. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends
Lynparza therapy in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive recurrent unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. Patients
with high risk early breast cancer should continue treatment for a total of 1 year, or until disease
recurrence, or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.
Lynparza is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious
germline or somatic homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-
resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide
or abiraterone. Lynparza is also indicated in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or
prednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA-
mutated (BRCAm) mCRPC. Patients receiving Lynparza for mCRPC should also receive a
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had a bilateral
orchiectomy.
Lynparza is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected
deleterious gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma whose disease has not progressed on at
least 16 weeks of a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.
The NCCN also recommends Lynparza therapy in patients with uterine sarcoma as single-agent
second-line therapy.
