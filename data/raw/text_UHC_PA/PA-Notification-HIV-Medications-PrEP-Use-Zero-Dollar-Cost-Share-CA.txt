Medication HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) Zero Dollar Cost Share – generic
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg
P&T Approval Date 11/2019, 8/2020, 9/2020, 9/2021, 9/2022, 9/2023, 9/2024
Effective Date 12/1/2024
1. Background:
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that clinicians offer
preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with effective antiretroviral therapy to persons who are at high
risk of HIV acquisition.1
Once-daily oral treatment with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as PrEP in persons at risk of sexual
acquisition of HIV infection. Several studies reviewed by the USPSTF found that tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate alone was also effective as PrEP and CDC guidelines note that, given these
trial data, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate alone can be considered as an alternative regimen for
high-risk heterosexually active men and women and persons who inject drugs.1-3
This program is designed to meet Health Care Reform requirements which require coverage of
effective antiretroviral therapy, which includes tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at zero-dollar cost
share if being used for PrEP and criteria are met.
2. Coverage Criteria:
A. Upon request, coverage at zero-dollar cost share of generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
300 mg will be approved based on both of the following criteria:
1. Member is taking generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg as effective antiretroviral
therapy for PrEP
-AND-
2. Generic tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg will be used as part of a comprehensive
prevention strategy including other prevention measures
Authorization will be issued for zero copay with deductible bypass for 12 months. If
zero-dollar cost share criteria are not met the requested drug will default to standard
plan coverage.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-
authorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10)
