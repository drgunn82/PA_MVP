1. Background:
Vosevi is a fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleotide analog
NS5B polymerase inhibitor, velpatasvir, an HCV NS5A inhibitor, and voxilaprevir, an HCV
NS3/4A protease inhibitor, and is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic
HCV infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) who have:1
• Genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection and have previously been treated with an HCV
regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor.
• Genotype 1a or 3 infection and have previously been treated with an HCV regimen
containing sofosbuvir without an NS5A inhibitor.
Additional benefit of Vosevi over Epclusa® (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir) was not shown in
o
adults with genotype 1b, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection previously treated with sofosbuvir
without an NS5A inhibitor.
