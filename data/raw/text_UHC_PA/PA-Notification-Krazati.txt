P&T Approval Date 2/2023, 2/2024, 8/2024
Effective Date 11/1/2024
1. Background:
Krazati™ (adagrasib) is an inhibitor of the RAS GTPase family indicated for as a single agent, for
the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. Krazati is
also indicated in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS
G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) who have received prior
treatment with fluorpyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends the use of Krazati as a
single agent for the treatment of KRAS G12C mutation positive progressive ampullary
adenocarcinoma, as subsequent therapy for KRAS G12 mutation positive locally advanced or
metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, for the treatment of brain metastases in KRAS G12C-
mutated NSCLC, as subsequent therapy for KRAS G12C mutation positive recurrent NSCLC, as
subsequent therapy for KRAS G`12 mutation positive unresectable or resected gross residual (R2)
disease, or biliary tract cancer. NCCN also recommends the use of Krazati in combination with
panitumumab or as a single agent for patients with KRAS G12C-mutated unresectable metastatic
CRC and previous FOLFOX (fluorauracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) or CapeOX (capecitabine
and oxaliplatin), and as adjuvant, second-line and subsequent therapy in combination with
cetuximab or panitumumab or as a single agent, if not previously given, for progression of
advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, or patient is ineligible for or progressed on checkpoint
inhibitor immunotherapy.
