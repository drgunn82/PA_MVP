1. Background:
Natpara® is a parathyroid hormone indicated as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control
hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism.
Limitations of Use:
• Because of the potential risk of osteosarcoma, Natpara is recommended only for patients who
cannot be well-controlled on calcium supplements and active forms of vitamin D alone. It is
available only through a restricted program called the Natpara REMS Program.
• Natpara was not studied in patients with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing
receptor mutations.
• Natpara was not studied in patients with acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism.
