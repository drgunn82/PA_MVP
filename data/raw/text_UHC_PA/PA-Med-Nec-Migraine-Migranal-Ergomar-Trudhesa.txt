1. Background:
Migranal* (dihydroergotamine) and Trudhesa* (dihydroergotamine) are indicated for the
acute treatment of migraine headaches with or without aura. Neither Migranal* nor
Trudhesa* are intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for the management of
hemiplegic or basilar migraine.
Ergomar is indicated to abort or prevent vascular headache, for example, migraine, migraine
variants or a so-called "histaminic cephalalgia”. Ergomar should not be used for chronic
daily administration.
The American Headache Society consensus statement recommends use of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), nonopioid analgesics, acetaminophen, or caffeinated
analgesic combinations (e.g., aspirin + acetaminophen + caffeine) for mild-to-
moderate attacks and migraine-specific agents (triptans, dihydroergotamine [DHE], small-
molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, selective serotonin (5- HT1F) receptor agonist for
moderate or severe attacks and mild-to- moderate attacks that respond poorly to nonspecific
therapy.
This program requires a member to try one oral triptan and two nasal triptans prior to
receiving coverage for nasal dihydroergotamine or two oral triptans prior to receiving
coverage of Ergomar.
