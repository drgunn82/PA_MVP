1. Background:
Tymlos (abaloparatide) is a human parathyroid hormone analog indicated for the treatment of
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture or patients who have failed or
are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. Tymlos is also indicated to increase bone
density in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture or patients who have failed or are
intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.1
The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology
(AACE/ACE) recommend the use of abaloparatide in patients unable to use oral therapy and as
initial therapy for patients at very high fracture risk defined as the following: patients with a
recent fracture (e.g., within the past 12 months), fractures while on approved osteoporosis
therapy, multiple fractures, fractures while on drugs causing skeletal harm (e.g., long-term
glucocorticoids), very low T-score (e.g., less than −3.0), high risk for falls or history of
injurious falls, and very high fracture probability by FRAX® (fracture risk assessment tool)
(e.g., major osteoporosis fracture >30%, hip fracture >4.5%) or other validated fracture risk
algorithm to be at very high fracture risk.2 Additionally, the AACE/ACE and Endocrine Society
both recommend to limit treatment with abaloparatide to 2 years.2-3
The safety and efficacy of Tymlos have not been evaluated beyond 2 years of treatment.
Cumulative use of Tymlos and other parathyroid hormone analogs (e.g., Forteo, Teriparatide
Injection) for more than 2 years during a patient’s lifetime is not recommended.1-3
Coverage will be provided for members who meet the following criteria.

-OR-
(2) Both of the following:
(a) Patient is male
-AND-
(b) Diagnosis of osteoporosis
-AND-
b. One of the following:
(1) Patient is at high risk of fracture [e.g., recent fracture (e.g., within the past 12
months), fractures while on approved osteoporosis therapy, multiple fractures,
fractures while on drugs causing skeletal harm (e.g., long-term glucocorticoids),
very low T-score (e.g., less than −3.0), high risk for falls or history of injurious
falls, and very high fracture probability by FRAX® (fracture risk assessment
tool) (e.g., major osteoporosis fracture >30%, hip fracture >4.5%)]
-OR-
(2) Patient has a history of failure, intolerance or contraindication to other available
osteoporosis therapy (e.g., alendronate, denosumab, risedronate, zoledronate)
-AND-
c. Treatment duration has not exceeded a total of 24 months of cumulative use of
parathyroid hormone analogs (e.g., Teriparatide Injection, Forteo, Tymlos) during
the patient’s lifetime
Authorization will be issued for up to 24 months. (Duration of coverage will be
limited to 24 months of cumulative parathyroid hormone analog therapy (e.g.,
Teriparatide Injection, Forteo, Tymlos) in the member’s lifetime.)
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific
benefit plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization
management programs may apply.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization
based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.
Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.
