Motegrity (prucalopride) is indicated for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation

treatment with Motegrity. Linzess® (linaclotide) is indicated for the treatment of chronic

patients less than 2 years of age and in patients with known or suspected mechanical
gastrointestinal obstruction. Amitiza®* (lubiprostone) is indicated for the treatment of

and for the treatment opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients with chronic,
non-cancer pain, including patients with chronic pain related to prior cancer or its
