1. Background:
Tafinlar (dabrafenib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation as detected by an FDA-
approved test. Tafinlar is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF solid
tumors.
Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist® (trametinib), is indicated for the treatment of patients with
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutations as detected
by an FDA-approved test and for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma with BRAF V600E or
BRAF V600K mutations, as detected by an FDA approved test, involving the lymph node(s),
following complete resection. Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, is indicated for the
treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with BRAF V600E
mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test, for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic
anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) with BRAF V600E mutation and with no satisfactory
locoregional treatment options, and for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age
and older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have
progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. The
latter indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and
duration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification
and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). Tafinlar, in combination with
Mekinist, is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with low-
grade glioma (LGG) with a BRAF V600E mutation who require systemic therapy.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends use of Tafinlar in
combination with Mekinist for the adjuvant treatment of ATC with BRAF V600E mutations
following resection; and as monotherapy for the treatment of follicular, oncocytic, and papillary
thyroid carcinomas with a BRAF mutation; in combination with Mekinist for the treatment for
recurrent, advanced, or metastatic NSCLC in patients with BRAF V600E mutation, or as single
agent if the combination of Tafinlar and Mekinist is not tolerated; in the treatment of
glioblastomas and other high-grade gliomas; in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS)
cancer in patients with melanoma; ovarian cancer/fallopian tube cancer/primary peritoneal cancer
with persistent disease or recurrence in BRAF V600E positive tumors; pancreatic and ampullary
adenocarcinomas if BRAF V600E mutation positive; certain BRAF V600E mutation positive
histiocytic neoplasms and hepatobiliary cancers; hairy cell leukemia; salivary gland tumor; and
gastrointestinal stromal tumor.
