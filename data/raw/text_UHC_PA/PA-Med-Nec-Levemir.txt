1. Background:
The Endocrine Society recommends insulin NPH, an intermediate acting insulin, as the preferred
basal insulin in pregnancy. Patients may be switched to Levemir, a long-acting insulin, when
therapy with insulin NPH is inadequate. This program allows for coverage of Levemir for
pregnant patients when they have failed therapy with insulin NPH.

1. Patient is pregnant
-AND-
2. History of failure, contraindication, or intolerance to insulin NPH
Authorization will be issued for 9 months.
a State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific
benefit plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization
management programs may apply.

based on both of the following: 1) Provider attests use of this product is medically necessary
for the treatment of diabetes; and- 2) If applicable, clinical characteristics exist that preclude
the use of the covered preferred alternative(s) and use of the covered preferred alternative(s)
could result in worsening of patient’s condition or inadequate treatment (document

and/or therapeutic class.
