patients aged 1 year and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR
gene. If the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used
to detect the presence of the F508del mutation on both alleles of the CFTR gene.
Limitations of Use:
The efficacy and safety of Orkambi have not been established in patients with CF other than
those homozygous for the F508del mutation.
Members will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.
