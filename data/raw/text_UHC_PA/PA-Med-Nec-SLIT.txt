Effective Date 6/1/2025
1. Background:
The sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) medications are indicated for patients who have
symptoms of allergic rhinitis with natural exposure to allergens and who demonstrate specific
IgE antibodies to the relevant allergen. Grastek (Timothy grass pollen allergen extract) and
Oralair (Sweet Vernal, Orchard, Perennial Rye, Timothy, and Kentucky Blue Grass Mixed
Pollens allergen extract) are indicated for patients with grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis,
Ragwitek (short ragweed pollen allergen extract) is indicated for ragweed pollen-induced
allergic rhinitis and Odactra (Dermatophagoides farinae/Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus
allergen extract), is indicated for house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic rhinitis.
Candidates for allergen immunotherapy are patients whose symptoms are not adequately
controlled by medications, and avoidance measures have been ineffective. In addition, patients
experiencing unacceptable adverse effects of medications or who wish to reduce the long-term
use of medications may also be candidates for immunotherapy.
