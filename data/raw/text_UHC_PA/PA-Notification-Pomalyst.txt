1. Background:
Pomalyst® (pomalidomide) is a thalidomide analogue indicated for the treatment of adult
patients, in combination with dexamethasone, for patients with multiple myeloma who have
received at least two prior therapies including Revlimid® (lenalidomide) and a proteasome
inhibitor [e.g., Velcade® (bortezomib)] and have demonstrated disease progression on or
within 60 days of completion of the last therapy. Pomalyst is also indicated for adult patients
with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma (KS) after failure of highly active antiretroviral therapy
(HAART) or in patients with KS who are HIV-negative.1
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends use of Pomalyst for
the treatment of relapsed/refractory systemic light chain amyloidosis in combination with
dexamethasone and for the treatment of primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma.
Additionally, Pomalyst is recommended in NCCN for treatment of multiple myeloma in
combination of dexamethasone after receiving only one prior line of therapy or for induction
therapy for the management of POEMS.2
Due to embryo-fetal risk (pregnancy category X) associated with Pomalyst; it is available only
through the Pomalyst Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers
and pharmacies must be certified with the Pomalyst REMS Program by enrolling and
complying with the REMS requirements. Patients must sign a Patient-Physician agreement
form and comply with the REMS requirements. Specifically, female patients who are not
pregnant but can become pregnant must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception

dispense to patients who are authorized to receive the drug and must comply with REMS
requirements. Additional information may be found at: https://www.pomalystrems.com/.3
