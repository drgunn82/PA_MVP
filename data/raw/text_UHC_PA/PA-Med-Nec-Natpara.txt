1. Background:
Natpara® is a parathyroid hormone indicated as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control
hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism.
Limitations of Use:
Because of the potential risk of osteosarcoma, Natpara is recommended only for patients
o
who cannot be well-controlled on calcium supplements and active forms of vitamin D
alone. It is available only through a restricted program called the Natpara REMS Program.
Natpara was not studied in patients with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing
o
receptor mutations.
Natpara was not studied in patients with acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism.
