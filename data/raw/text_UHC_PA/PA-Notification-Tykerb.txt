1. Background:
Tykerb (lapatinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for use in combination with Femara® (letrozole)
for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive metastatic breast
cancer that overexpresses the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor for
whom hormonal therapy is indicated. Tykerb is also indicated in combination with Xeloda®
(capecitabine) for treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors
overexpress HER2 and who have received prior therapy, including an anthracycline, a taxane, and
trastuzumab. Patients should have disease progression on trastuzumab prior to initiation of
treatment with Tykerb in combination with Xeloda. The National Cancer Comprehensive Network
(NCCN) also recommends the use of Tykerb in metastatic central nervous system (CNS) lesions
with primary tumor of the breast, intracranial and spinal ependymomas, EGFR-positive chordoma,
and colon and rectal cancers not previously treated with HER2 inhibitors.
