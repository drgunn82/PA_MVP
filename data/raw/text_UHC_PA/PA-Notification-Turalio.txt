Turalio (pexidartinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with

The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) recommends Turalio as single-agent
therapy for the treatment of TGCT/ pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) in patients
without respect to morbidity and surgery eligibility. NCCN also recommends Turalio for
colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) mutation positive histiocytic neoplasms.
