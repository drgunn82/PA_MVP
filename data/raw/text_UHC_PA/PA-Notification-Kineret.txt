1. Background:
Kineret (anakinra) is an interleukin-1 receptor antagonist indicated for moderately to severely
active rheumatoid arthritis in patients 18 years of age or older who have failed one or more
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).1 Examples of DMARDs commonly
used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis include methotrexate, leflunomide, and
sulfasalazine.2,6 Kineret is also indicated for the treatment of Neonatal-Onset Multisystem
Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) and the treatment of deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor
antagonist (DIRA).1 Clinical evidence also supports the use of Kineret to treat active
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and adult onset Still’s disease.3,4,7, 8
