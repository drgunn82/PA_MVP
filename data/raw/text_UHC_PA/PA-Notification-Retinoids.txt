1. Background:
Topical retinoid products are indicated for cosmetic and medical conditions (e.g., acne vulgaris,
psoriasis, precancerous skin lesions). Cosmetic use is not a covered benefit per the
UnitedHealthcare pharmacy Rider. Therefore, Prior Authorization/Notification is in place to
verify the use is for the diagnosis of a medical condition. For covered medications, if members
are younger than 30 years of age the topical retinoid prescription will automatically adjudicate
without a coverage review.
2. Coverage Criteria:
