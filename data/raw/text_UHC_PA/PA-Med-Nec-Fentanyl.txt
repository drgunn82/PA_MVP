Program Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity - Fentanyl Transmucosal
Medication Actiq® (brand only)* (fentanyl transmucosal lozenge), Fentora®* (fentanyl
buccal tablet), and fentanyl citrate bulk powder*
P&T Approval Date 2/2016, 9/2016, 9/2017, 10/2018, 10/2019, 10/2020, 2/2022, 4/2022, 7/2023,

Effective Date 10/1/2024
1. Background:
Actiq, Fentora and fentanyl citrate lozenges (generic Actiq) are rapid-acting opioid analgesics
indicated for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients who are already receiving and
have developed tolerance to around-the-clock opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer
pain. Patients considered opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral morphine
daily, at least 25 mcg/hour of transdermal fentanyl, at least 30 mg of oxycodone daily, at least 8 mg
of oral hydromorphone daily, at least 25 mg of oral oxymorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of
another opioid for a week or longer. Patients must remain on around-the-clock opioids while taking a
rapid-acting fentanyl product. Actiq, Fentora, and fentanyl citrate lozenges (generic Actiq) must not
be used in opioid non-tolerant patients because life-threatening hypoventilation could occur at any
dose in patients not on a chronic regimen of opiates.
Compounded fentanyl preparations may provide a unique delivery for certain patient-specific
conditions and administration requirements. Compounded fentanyl preparations should be made for a
single individual and not produced on a large scale. Compounded fentanyl preparations should not be
covered if it is being prescribed as an alternative for a commercially available fentanyl product.
Therefore, additional criteria will be provided for fentanyl citrate compounds.
2. Coverage Criteriaa, b:

diagnosis must be documented in the medical records).
-AND-
b. Patient must have at least a one week history of one of the following medications to
demonstrate tolerance to opioids:
