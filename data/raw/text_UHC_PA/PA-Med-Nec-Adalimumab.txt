1. Background:
Adalimumab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker indicated for:
• Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response,
inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients
with moderately to severely active RA. Adalimumab can be used alone or in combination with
methotrexate or other non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
• Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA): reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active
polyarticular JIA in patients 2 years of age and older. Adalimumab can be used alone or in
combination with methotrexate.
• Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural
damage, and improving physical function in adult patients with active PsA.
• Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS): reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with active AS.
Adalimumab can be used alone or in combination with non-biologic DMARDs.
• Crohn’s Disease (CD): treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in adults and
pediatric patients 6 years of age and older.
• Ulcerative Colitis (UC): treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults and
pediatric patients 5 years of age and older.
• Plaque Psoriasis (Ps): treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis
who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, and when other systemic therapies are
medically less appropriate.
• Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS): treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in
patients 12 years of age and older.
• Uveitis (UV): treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in adults and
pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.
