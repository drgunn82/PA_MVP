1. Background:
Testosterone products are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
testosterone replacement therapy in males with primary hypogonadism (congenital or
acquired) or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or acquired). Primary
hypogonadism originates from a deficiency or disorder in the testicles. Secondary
hypogonadism indicates a problem in the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland. Testosterone
use has been strongly linked to improvements in muscle mass, bone density, and libido.
The purpose of this program is to provide coverage for androgens and anabolic steroid therapy
for the treatment of conditions for which they have shown to be effective and are within the
scope of the plan’s pharmacy benefit. Coverage for the enhancement of athletic performance
or body building will not be provided.
2. Coverage Criteriaa:
A. Initial Authorization for Hypogonadism
1. Topical testosterone (gel, solution), testosterone transdermal systems (patches),
and oral testosterone (capsules) will be approved based on one of the following:
a. Patient has a history of one of the following:

b. All of the following:
