Medication Mifeprex 200 mg and mifepristone (generic Mifeprex) 200 mg
P&T Approval Date 11/2022, 1/2023, 3/2024, 4/2025
Effective Date 7/1/2025
1. Background:
Effective January 3, 2023, the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for
Mifeprex (mifepristone) was revised to allow the product to be dispensed by certified retail and
mail order pharmacies. Previously, this product was only available when ordered, prescribed, and
dispensed by or under the supervision of a healthcare provider.
These products are standardly covered without prior authorization. The purpose of this program is
to determine coverage of Mifeprex 200 mg and mifepristone (generic Mifeprex) 200 mg when
variations to our standard are present in plan benefit documents (e.g., required by state mandate,
group choice, etc.).
2. Coverage Criteria:
A. Authorization
1. Mifeprex 200 mg and mifepristone (generic Mifeprex) 200 mg will be approved
based on the following criterion:
a. Treatment is required consistent with services covered by the patient’s medical
benefit plan. (For more information about covered and excluded termination of
pregnancy services, providers may review the patient’s medical benefit plan
document or access information contained in the member’s medical benefit plan
document, by contacting provider services at 1-888-842-3210, or accessing the
provider portal at www.uhcprovider.com)
Authorization will be issued for 1 month.
3. Additional Clinical Rules:
• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization
based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.
Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.
