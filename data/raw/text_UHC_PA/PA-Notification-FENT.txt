1. Background:
Actiq, Fentora, and fentanyl citrate lozenges (generic Actiq) are indicated for the management of
breakthrough cancer pain in patients who are already receiving and have developed tolerance to
around-the-clock opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. Patients considered
opioid tolerant are those who are taking at least 60 mg of oral morphine daily, at least 25
mcg/hour of transdermal fentanyl, at least 30 mg of oxycodone daily, at least 8 mg of oral
hydromorphone daily, at least 25 mg of oral oxymorphone daily or an equianalgesic dose of
another opioid for a week or longer. Patients must remain on around-the-clock opioids while
taking one of these fentanyl products. Actiq, Fentora, and fentanyl citrate lozenges (generic
Actiq) must not be used in opioid non-tolerant patients because life-threatening hypoventilation
could occur at any dose in patients not on a chronic regimen of opiates.
Compounded fentanyl preparations may provide a unique delivery for certain patient-specific
conditions and administration requirements. Compounded fentanyl preparations should be made
for a single individual and not produced on a large scale. Compounded fentanyl preparations
should not be covered if it is being prescribed as an alternative for a commercially available
fentanyl product. Therefore, additional criteria will be required for fentanyl citrate compounds.
2. Coverage Criteriaa, b:
A. Actiq*, fentanyl citrate lozenges (generic Actiq*) or Fentora* will be approved based on one
of the following criteria:
1. Submission of medical records demonstrating all of the following:
a. Use is for the management of breakthrough pain associated with a cancer diagnosis
(cancer diagnosis must be documented in the medical records).
-AND-
b. Patient must have at least a one week history of one of the following medications to
demonstrate tolerance to opioids:
1) Oral morphine sulfate at a dose of greater than or equal to 60 mg/day
2) Fentanyl transdermal patch at a dose of greater than or equal to 25 mcg/hr
3) Oral oxycodone at a dose of greater than or equal to 30 mg/day
