1. Background:
Mektovi® (binimetinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated, in combination with Braftovi®
(encorafenib), for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a
BRAF V600E or V600K mutation and for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600E mutation.
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) guideline also recommends use of
Mektovi in melanoma for NRAS-mutated tumors that have progressed after prior immune
checkpoint inhibitor therapy, recurrent or advanced NSCLC with a BRAF V600E mutation,
Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis, low-grade serous carcinoma, and in combination with imatinib
(Gleevec) for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)
with gross residual disease (R2 resection), unresectable primary disease, tumor rupture or
recurrent/metastatic disease.
Coverage Information:
Members will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage. For members under the age
of 19 years, the prescription will automatically process without a coverage review.
Some states mandate benefit coverage for off-label use of medications for some diagnoses or
