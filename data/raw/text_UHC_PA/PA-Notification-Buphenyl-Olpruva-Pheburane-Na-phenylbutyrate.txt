deficiency, presenting after the first month of life) who have a history of hyperammonemic
encephalopathy. Sodium phenylbutyrate must be used with dietary protein restriction and, in
some cases, dietary supplements (e.g., essential amino acids, arginine, citrulline, protein-free
calorie supplements).
