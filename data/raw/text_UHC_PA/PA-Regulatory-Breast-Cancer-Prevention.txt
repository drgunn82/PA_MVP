The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)1 recommends that clinicians engage in
shared, informed decision making with women who are at increased risk for breast cancer

aged 35 years or older and at low risk of adverse medication effects, clinicians should offer to
prescribe risk-reducing medications.

letrozole (generic Femara), or exemestane (generic Aromasin)] at zero-dollar cost share if
