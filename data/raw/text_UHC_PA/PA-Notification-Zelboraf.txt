1. Background:
Zelboraf (vemurafenib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with
unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation as detected by an FDA-
approved test. It is also indicated for the treatment of patients with Erdheim-Chester Disease
with BRAF V600 mutation. Zelboraf is not recommended for use in patients with wild-type
BRAF melanoma.1
The National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) guideline recommends use of Zelboraf
in combination with Cotellic (cobimetinib) for treatment of central nervous system (CNS) cancer
and metastatic or unresectable melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation (or as a single agent if
BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy is contraindicated). Zelboraf is also recommended
for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Langerhans cell
histiocytosis (LCH), and follicular, Hürthle cell, and papillary thyroid carcinomas with a BRAF
mutation.2
Information on FDA-approved tests for the detection of BRAF V600 mutations in melanoma
may be found at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.1
