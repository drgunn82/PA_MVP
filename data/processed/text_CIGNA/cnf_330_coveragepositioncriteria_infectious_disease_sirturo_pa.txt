INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Sirturo, a diarylquinolone antimycobacterial, is indicated as part of a combination
therapy in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to Mycobacterium
tuberculosis resistant to at least rifampin and isoniazid in patients ≥ 5 years of age
(weighing ≥ 15 kg).1 Reserve Sirturo for use when an effective treatment regimen
cannot otherwise be provided.
Limitations of use: Sirturo should not be used for the treatment of latent infections
due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, drug-sensitive TB, extra-pulmonary TB, and
infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria.
The prescribing information notes the total duration of treatment with Sirturo to be
24 weeks (adults and pediatric patients).1
Guidelines
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Infectious Disease – Sirturo Prior Authorization Policy
The World Health Organization issued an operational handbook (2023) with
information on the choice and design of regimens for the treatment of drug-resistant
TB, including multidrug- or rifampin-resistant TB and confirmed rifampicin-
susceptible, isoniazid-resistant TB.2 Drug susceptibility tests are recommended to
assist the prescriber in choosing the appropriate initial regimen. In addition, a
surveillance system is recommended to determine the local prevalence of drug-
resistant TB strains. There are different regimens that include Sirturo and other drugs
(e.g., rifampicin, ethambutol, levofloxacin/moxifloxacin, pretomanid, linezolid,
clofazimine).
On December 31, 2024 the American Thoracic Society, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the European Respiratory Society, and the Infectious Disease
Society of America published an official practice guideline for the treatment of drug-
susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis in which they recommended a 6-month
treatment duration as opposed to previously recommended longer durations (up to
15 months).4
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Sirturo. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Sirturo as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Sirturo to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.

Revision
Early Annual Tuberculosis: The criterion, “Patient has multidrug-resistant 07/03/2024
Revision tuberculosis” was changed to “Patient has Mycobacterium
tuberculosis resistant to rifampin and isoniazid.”
Sirturo received traditional approval from the FDA. The indication for
use was changed from “Sirturo is indicated as part of a combination
therapy in the treatment of pulmonary multidrug-resistant
tuberculosis (TB) in patients ≥ 5 years of age (weighing ≥ 15 kg)” to
“Situro is indicated as part of a combination therapy in the treatment
of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis
resistant to at least rifampin and isoniazidin patients ≥ 5 years of age
(weighing ≥ 15 kg).”
The limitation “The safety and efficacy of Sirturo in the treatment of
patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with
multidrug-resistant TB have not been established as clinical data are
limited” has been removed from the policy.
Annual Tuberculosis. The approved duration for this condition was changed 07/16/2025
