I NSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR
PLAN DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE
BASED. FOR EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC
ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES
THE INFORMATION IN THE COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE,
BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS
IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON
THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING
COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED
ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE
DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON
SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES, REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR
PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE
NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY (SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE
MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT
ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE
POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED
VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Leqselvi, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of severe
alopecia areata in patients > 18 years of age.1 Leqselvi has greater inhibitory
potency for JAK1, JAK2, and tyrosine kinase (TYK)-2 relative to JAK3.
Guidelines
Although specific drugs are not mentioned, JAK inhibitors (JAKis) as a therapeutic
class are addressed in an international expert opinion on treatments for alopecia
areata (2020).2 JAKis are identified amongst the therapies for treatment of extensive
hair loss. First-line treatments for adults include high- or super-high potency topical
corticosteroids and/or systemic corticosteroids. Steroid-sparing therapies to mitigate
the risk associated with prolonged use of corticosteroids include cyclosporine,
methotrexate, azathioprine, and JAKis. Based on the expert opinion, JAKis are
considered the ideal option amongst systemic, steroid-sparing agents.

Authorization Policy
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Leqselvi. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Leqselvi as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Leqselvi to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Leqselvi™ (deuruxolitinib tablets – Sun)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Alopecia Areata. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of the
following (A or B):
Note: Alopecia universalis and alopecia totalis are subtypes of alopecia areata.
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets ALL of the following
(i, ii, iii, iv, v, and vi):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Patient is not a cytochrome P450 2C9 poor metabolizer as assessed by an
approved test; AND
iii. Patient has a current episode of alopecia areata lasting for ≥ 6 months;
AND
iv. Patient has ≥ 50% scalp hair loss; AND
v. Patient has tried at least ONE of the following for alopecia areata (a or b):
a) Conventional systemic therapy; OR
Note: Examples of conventional systemic therapies include
corticosteroids, methotrexate, and cyclosporine. An exception to the
requirement for a trial of one conventional systemic agent can be made
if the patient has already tried Litfulo (ritlecitinib capsules) or Olumiant
(baricitinib tablets).
b) High- or super-high potency topical corticosteroid; AND
vi. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a dermatologist; OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Leqselvi. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
ALL of the following (i, ii, iii, and iv):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Patient has been established on Leqselvi for at least 6 months; AND
Note: A patient who has received < 6 months of therapy or who is
restarting therapy with the requested drug is reviewed under criterion A
(Initial Therapy).
iii. Patient experienced a beneficial clinical response, defined as improvement
from baseline (prior to initiating Leqselvi) in extent and density of scalp hair
loss; AND

Authorization Policy
iv. According to the prescriber, the patient continues to require systemic
therapy for treatment of alopecia areata.
Note: International consensus states that systemic treatment is best
discontinued once complete regrowth has been achieved and maintained
for 6 months or when regrowth is sufficient to be managed topically.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Leqselvi™ (deuruxolitinib tablets – Sun)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
2. Concurrent Use with a Topical Janus Kinase Inhibitor (JAKi).1 Leqselvi
should not be administered in combination with another topical JAKi. Combination
therapy is generally not recommended due to a potential for a higher rate of
adverse effects and lack of evidence for additive efficacy.
Note: Examples include Opzelura (ruxolitinib cream) and Anzupgo (delgocitinib
cream).
3. Concurrent Use with a Biologic Immunomodulator. Leqselvi is not
recommended in combination with biologic immunomodulators.1
Note: Examples include Adbry (tralokinumab-ldrm subcutaneous injection),
Cinqair (reslizumab intravenous), Dupixent (dupilumab subcutaneous injection),
Ebglyss (lebrikizumab-lbkz subcutaneous injection), Nemluvio (nemolizumab-ilto
subcutaneous injection), Fasenra (benralizumab subcutaneous injection), Nucala
(mepolizumab subcutaneous injection), Tezspire (tezepelumab-ekko
subcutaneous injection), and Xolair (omalizumab subcutaneous injection).
4. Concurrent Use with Other Potent Immunosuppressants (e.g.,
cyclosporine, azathioprine).1 Co-administration with other potent
immunosuppressive drugs has the risk of added immunosuppression and has not
been evaluated.
