INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Wainua, a transthyretin (TTR)-directed antisense oligonucleotide, is indicated for the
treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary TRR-mediated amyloidosis
(hATTR) in adults.1 Wainua has not been studied in patients with prior liver
transplantation. hATTR is a progressive disease caused by mutations in the TTR gene
leading to multisystem organ dysfunction.2 Common neurologic manifestations
include sensiomotor polyneuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, small-fiber
polyneuropathy, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
Guidelines
There are no guidelines that include recommendations for Wainua. A scientific
statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) on the treatment of the
cardiomyopathy of hATTR amyloidosis (July 2020) includes recommendations related
to polyneuropathy.3 Canadian guidelines for the treatment of patients with
polyneuropathy (February 2021) and recommendations from the European Society
of Cardiology (ESC) [2021] include treatment recommendations for hATTR
polyneuropathy as well.2,4 In general, Onpattro® (patisiran intravenous infusion) and
Tegsedi® (inotersen subcutaneous injection) are recommended for patients with
hATTR polyneuropathy.
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Amyloidosis – Wainua Prior Authorization Policy
For patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy, the AHA recommends
treatment with Onpattro or Tegsedi.3 For patients with hATTR with polyneuropathy
and cardiomyopathy, Onpattro, Tegsedi, or Vyndamax® (tafamidis meglumine
capsules)/Vyndaqel™ (tafamidis capsules) are recommended. Use of combination
therapy is discussed; however, it is noted that there is little data to support
combination therapy.
The Canadian guidelines recommend Onpattro and Tegsedi as first-line treatment to
stop the progression of neuropathy and improve polyneuropathy in early and late
stage hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy.2
The ESC Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure
note that TTR stabilization and reduction are the recommended basis of treatment
for cardiomyopathy of hATTR.4 Onpattro and Tegsedi may be considered for patients
with hATTR polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Wainua. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Wainua as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Wainua to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Wainua™ (eplontersen subcutaneous injection - AstraZeneca)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Polyneuropathy of Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated Amyloidosis
(hATTR). Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of the following (A, B, C,
D, and E):
Note: Variant Transthyretin Amyloidosis is also known as Hereditary Transthyretin
Amyloidosis.
A) Patient is ≥18 years of age; AND
B) Patient has a transthyretin (TTR) pathogenic variant as confirmed by genetic
testing; AND
C) Patient has symptomatic polyneuropathy; AND
Note: Examples of symptomatic polyneuropathy include reduced motor
strength/coordination, and impaired sensation (e.g., pain, temperature,
vibration, touch). Examples of assessments for symptomatic disease include
history and clinical exam, electromyography, or nerve conduction velocity
testing.
D) Patient does not have a history of liver transplantation; AND

E) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist,
geneticist, or a physician who specializes in the treatment of amyloidosis.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Wainua™ (eplontersen subcutaneous injection - AstraZeneca)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concurrent use with other medications indicated for the treatment of
polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis or
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis-cardiomyopathy (e.g., Amvuttra
[vutrisiran subcutaneous injection], Attruby [acoramidis tablets],
Onpattro [patisiran intravenous infusion], Tegsedi [inotersen
subcutaneous injection], or a tafamidis product.)
The requested medication should not be administered in combination with other
medications indicated for polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated
amyloidosis or transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis-cardiomyopathy.
Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a lack of controlled
clinical trial data supporting additive efficacy.
