GUIDELINES
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical practice guideline for the
diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents was
updated in 2019, and incorporates many of the findings from the Multimodal
Treatment Study of Children With ADHD (MTA).24 The AAP recommendations for
treatment of children and youth with ADHD vary depending on the patient’s age.
For preschool-aged children (4 to 5 years of age), parent- and/or teacher-
administered behavior therapy should be prescribed as first-line treatment;
methylphenidate may be prescribed if behavior interventions do not provide
significant improvement and disturbance of function continues. For elementary
school-aged children (6 to 11 years of age), an FDA-approved medication for ADHD
(and/or behavior therapy, but preferably both) should be prescribed. Evidence is
particularly strong for stimulant medications, and sufficient but less strong for
atomoxetine, guanfacine extended-release (ER) tablets, and clonidine ER tablets (in
that order). For adolescents (12 to 18 years of age), an FDA-approved medication
for ADHD (and/or behavior therapy, but preferably both) should be prescribed with
the assent of the adolescent. The dose of medication should be titrated to achieve
maximum benefit with minimum adverse events (AEs). The findings from the MTA
study suggested that more than 70% of children and youth with ADHD respond to
7 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Stimulant
Medications Step Therapy Policy
one of the stimulant medications at an optimal dose when a systematic trial is used.
Titration to maximum doses that control symptoms without AEs is recommended
instead of titration strictly on a mg-per-kg basis.
Methylphenidate and amphetamine formulations have similar effects and AEs, and
remain the first choice of medication treatment.24 Some patients will respond
better to or display more AEs with one compound vs. another; however, these
effects cannot be predetermined. Therefore, if a trial with one group is
unsuccessful (poor efficacy or AEs), a trial on a medication from the other group
should be undertaken. At least half of the patients whose symptoms fail to respond
to one stimulant medication may have a positive response to the alternative
medication.
The AAP clinical practice guideline on the identification and management of eating
disorders in children and adolescents (2021) notes that research on the treatment
of binge eating disorder lags behind that for other eating disorders and has been
focused primarily on adults.25 Vyvanse was approved by the FDA in 2015 for the
treatment of moderate to severe binge-eating disorder in adults. Vyvanse has
demonstrated efficacy in reducing the frequency of binge-eating episodes. As with
the use of other central nervous system stimulants, there is a potential for abuse
and dependence as well as serious cardiovascular reactions. Topiramate has been
shown to reduce binge eating and help with weight loss; however, the rates of
adverse effects are relatively high. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have
rarely differed from placebo in their effect on binge-eating disorder and have not
shown better outcome than behavioral therapy alone.
DOSING AND DOSAGE FORMS
The choice of formulation depends on factors such as the efficacy of each agent for
a given child/adolescent, the preferred length of coverage time, whether a child can
swallow tablets or capsules, and expense.24 The extended-release (ER)
formulations may be preferred over immediate-release (IR) formulations because
they provide benefits of consistent and sustained coverage with fewer
administrations per day. Long-acting formulations usually preclude the need for
school-based administration of ADHD medications. Better coverage with fewer
administrations leads to greater convenience for the family and, therefore, might
also lead to better adherence to the medication management plan. Some patients,
particularly adolescents, might require more than 12 hours of coverage to ensure
adequate focus and concentration during evening study time and driving; in these
cases, a short-acting (IR) preparation might be used in addition to a long-acting
(ER) preparation.
Many of the generic ER stimulant medications for the treatment of ADHD are
available as capsules: generic amphetamine/dextroamphetamine ER capsules
(generic to Adderall XR; Mydayis, generic), generic dexmethylphenidate ER
capsules (generic to Focalin XR), lisdexamfetamine capsules (Vyvanse, generic),
and generic methylphenidate ER capsules (generic to Metadate CD, Ritalin LA,
Adhansia XR, Aptensio XR). According to the prescribing information, the capsules
may be taken whole, or opened and the entire contents sprinkled on

applesauce.1,5,6,9,13,20 Patients should take the applesauce with sprinkled beads in
