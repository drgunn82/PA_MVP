INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Rezurock, a kinase inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-
host disease (GVHD) in patients ≥ 12 years of age after failure of at least two prior
lines of systemic therapy.1
Guidelines
Rezurock has been addressed in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network
Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation guidelines (version 1.2025 – February 28, 2025).
Options for first-line therapy for chronic GVHD including restarting, continuing, or
escalating the original immunosuppressive agent(s) and/or administering systemic
corticosteroids (0.5 to 1 mg/kg day of methylprednisolone or prednisone dose
equivalent). Among the agents FDA-approved for use in chronic GVHD, Jakafi®
(ruxolitinib tablets) is the only agent given a category 1 recommendation for chronic
GVHD. Rezurock, Niktimvo™ (axatilimab-csfr intravenous infusion), and Imbruvica®
(ibrutinib tablets, capsules, and oral suspension) each have a category 2A

be used following failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy (depending on the
agent). Other medication alternatives include Orencia® (abatacept intravenous [IV]
infusion and subcutaneous [SC] injection), Lemtrada® (alemtuzumab IV infusion),
calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine), Enbrel® (etanercept SC

Revision
Early Annual The header was changed from “Immunosuppressive Agents” to “Graft- 05/07/2025
Revision Versus-Host Disease”.
Graft-Versus-Host Disease: The criteria were divided into “Initial
Therapy” and “Patient Currently Receiving Rezurock”. For initial
therapy, for the requirement that a patient tried two systemic
treatments, the descriptor “conventional” was removed and the word
“therapies” was changed to “medications”. Also, the Note that cites
examples of systemic medications for chronic graft-versus-host
disease was updated to add the following: Jakafi (ruxolitinib tablets),
Niktimvo (axatilimab-csfr intravenous infusion), hydroxychloroquine,
methotrexate, rituximab, pentostatin, interleukin-2 (e.g., Proleukin
[aldesleukin intravenous infusion]), and an etanercept product. For a
patient currently receiving Rezurock, an approval is given if according
to the prescriber, the patient demonstrates a beneficial clinical
response. A Note was added that a beneficial response can include a
reduction in corticosteroid dose, disease stabilization, and/or
symptomatic improvement.
