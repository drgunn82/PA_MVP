SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE

CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Qfitlia, an antithrombin-directed small interfering ribonucleic acid, is indicated for the
routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adults
and pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age with hemophilia A or B with or without Factor
VIII or Factor IX inhibitors.1
Qfitlia is given by subcutaneous (SC) injection only.1 The initial dose is 50 mg SC
once every 2 months (Q2M). Monitor antithrombin activity utilizing an FDA-cleared
test. Maintain antithrombin activity between 15% to 35% by adjusting the dose
and/or frequency of administration. Other dose regimens include: 50 mg SC once
monthly (QM); 20 mg SC Q2M; 20 mg SC QM; 10 mg SC Q2M; and 10 mg SC QM.
Qfitlia may be given by the patient and/or caregiver after proper training. In pediatric
patients 12 to 17 years of age, Qfitlia should be given by or under the supervision of
an adult.

Disease Overview
Hemophilia A and B are genetic bleeding disorders caused by a dysfunction or
deficiency of coagulation Factor VIII and Factor IX, respectively.2-7 Because
hemophilia is an X-linked condition, males are primarily impacted. Patients who have
these types of hemophilias are not able to properly form clots in the blood and may
bleed for a longer time than normal following injury or surgery. Patients may also
experience spontaneous bleeding in muscles, joints, and organs. Bleeds may be life-
threatening. A main morbidity is hemophilic arthropathy, which limits mobility. It is
estimated that 33,000 males are living with hemophilia in the US; hemophilia A
accounts for around 80% of the cases (approximately 26,400 patients) and
hemophilia B comprises 20% of cases (around 6,600 patients). Hemophilias are
often classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on reduced Factor VIII or IX
levels. Approximately 50% and 30% of patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia
B, respectively, have severe disease. The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) to
factor products is a challenging complication as it causes Factor VIII and Factor IX
therapies to be ineffective, which increases bleeding frequency and severity.
Inhibitors develop in around 30% and 10% of patients with severe hemophilia A and
hemophilia B, respectively.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Qfitlia. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Qfitlia as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Qfitlia to be prescribed by or in consultation with a hemophilia specialist.

Revision Date
New Policy -- 04/09/2025
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hemophilia – Non-Factor Routine Prophylaxis Products –
Qfitlia Prior Authorization Policy
Early Annual “Non-Factor Routine Prophylaxis Products” was added to the title of 06/11/2025
Revision the Policy. In addition, the following changes were made:
Hemophilia A without Factor VIII Inhibitors: For Initial Therapy,
the requirement that “Patient has severe hemophilia A as evidenced
by a baseline (without Factor VIII replacement therapy) Factor VIII
level of < 1%” was changed to “Patient has moderately severe to
severe hemophilia A as evidence by a baseline (without Factor VIII
replacement therapy) Factor VIII level of ≤ 2%”. The requirement
regarding prophylactic use of Factor VIII products was changed from
“will not occur 7 days after the initiation of Qfitlia therapy” to “will be
discontinued no later than 7 days following the initial Qfitlia dose”. For
a Patient Currently Receiving Qfitlia, regarding prophylactic use of
Factor VIII products, the word “using” was changed to “receiving”.
Hemophilia A with Factor VIII Inhibitors: For Initial Therapy,
regarding prophylactic use of bypassing agents, the phrase “will not
occur 7 days after the initiation of Qfitlia therapy” was changed to “will
be discontinued no later than 7 days following the initial Qfitlia dose”.
For a Patient Currently Receiving Qfitlia, the word “products” was
removed after “bypassing agents” and “using” was changed to
“receiving” regarding prophylactic use. For both Initial Therapy and
for a Patient Currently Receiving Qfiltia, a requirement was added
that the patient is not undergoing immune tolerance induction
therapy. Previously, this was addressed in Conditions Not Covered
.
Hemophilia B without Factor IX Inhibitors: For Initial Therapy,
the requirement that patients have “moderately severe or severe
hemophilia B” was changed to “moderately severe to severe
hemophilia B”. The requirement regarding prophylactic use of Factor
IX products was changed from “will not occur 7 days after the initiation
of Qfitlia therapy” to “will be discontinued no later than 7 days
following the initial Qfitlia dose”. For a Patient Currently Receiving
Qfitlia, regarding prophylactic use of Factor IX products, the word
“using” was changed to “receiving”. In the Note that addresses a
beneficial response, the phrase “to therapy” was added and
“spontaneous bleeding events” was changed to “spontaneous bleeds.”
Hemophilia B with Factor IX Inhibitors: In Initial Therapy,
regarding prophylactic use of bypassing agents, the phrase “will not
occur 7 days after the initiation of Qfitlia therapy” was changed to “will
be discontinued no later than 7 days following the initial Qfitlia dose”.
For a Patient Currently Receiving Qfitlia, the word “products” was
removed after “bypassing agents” and “using” was changed to
“receiving” regarding prophylactic use. For both Initial Therapy and
for a Patient Currently Receiving Qfiltia, a requirement was added that
the patient is not undergoing immune tolerance induction therapy
while receiving Qfitlia. Previously, this was addressed in Conditions
Not Covered
.
Conditions Not Covered
: Regarding Concurrent Use of Non-Factor Routine Prophylaxis
Products, all agents are now listed together in one criterion. Patient
Receiving Immune Tolerance Induction Therapy was removed as this
is now addressed in approval criteria in patients with inhibitors.
