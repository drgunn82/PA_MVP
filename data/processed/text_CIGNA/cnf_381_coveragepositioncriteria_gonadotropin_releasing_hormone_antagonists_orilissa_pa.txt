INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Orilissa, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, is
indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with
endometriosis.1 Limitation of Use. Limit the duration of use based on the dose
and coexisting condition.
The recommended dosage is 150 mg once daily (QD) for up to 24 months (no
coexisting conditions) or 200 mg twice daily (BID) for up to 6 months (in patients
with coexisting dyspareunia). In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-
Pugh Class B), the recommended dosage is 150 mg QD for up to 6 months and the
use of 200 mg BID is not recommended. Orilissa is contraindicated in patients with
severe hepatic impairment. Duration of therapy is limited due to the anti-
estrogenic effects of the medication which include a decrease in bone mineral
density.
Disease Overview
Endometriosis is a condition where the tissues similar to the lining of the uterus (or
endometrium) migrate outside of the womb to other body sites.2,3 The migrated
tissues are generally found in the pelvic cavity (e.g., peritoneum, uterosacral

ligaments, rectal-vaginal septum, or any spaces between the bladder, uterus,
vagina, and rectum) and can attach to any of the female reproductive organs (e.g.,
ovaries, fallopian tubes). The migrated tissue is less commonly found outside the
pelvic cavity or on the intestines, colon, appendix or rectum. Endometriosis
impacts up to 10% of patients of reproductive age in the US.3
Guidelines
According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists practice
bulletin on the management of endometriosis (2010, reaffirmed 2018), empiric
therapy with a 3-month course of a GnRH agonist is appropriate after an
appropriate pretreatment evaluation (to exclude other causes of chronic pelvic pain)
and failure of initial treatment with oral contraceptives and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),.2
