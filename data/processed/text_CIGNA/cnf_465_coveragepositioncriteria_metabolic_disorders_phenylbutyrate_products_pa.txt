INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Phenylbutyrate products are indicated in combination with dietary management for
treatment of urea cycle disorders (UCDs).1-4
• Sodium phenylbutyrate products are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the chronic
management of adult and pediatric patients with UCDs involving deficiencies of
carbamylphosphate synthetase (CPS), ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), or
argininosuccinic acid synthetase (AS).1-3
o Buphenyl and Pheburane can be administered orally in pediatric patients
weighing < 20 kg.
o Buphenyl powder is compatible with feeding tube administration.
o Olpruva is indicated for use in patients weighing > 20 kg and with a body
surface area of > 1.2 m2.
Limitation of use: Sodium phenylbutyrate products are not indicated for the
treatment of acute hyperammonemia, which can be a life-threatening medical
emergency that requires rapid acting interventions to reduce plasma ammonia
levels.
• Ravicti is indicated for the chronic management of patients with UCDs who cannot
be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone.4

Authorization Policy
Limitation of use: Ravicti is not indicated for treatment of acute hyperammonemia in
patients with UCDs. Safety and efficacy for treatment of N-acetylglutamate
synthetase deficiency has not been established.
Disease Overview
UCDs are rare inborn errors of metabolism which result from mutations in the genes
encoding for enzymes necessary for normal function of the urea cycle: arginase, AS, N-
acetyl glutamate synthetase, OTC, and CPS.5,6 These defects lead to increased amounts of
ammonia in the blood which may cause disturbed brain function and severe brain damage.
Signs of disease include decreased mental awareness, vomiting, combativeness, slurred
speech, unstable gait, and unconsciousness. Diagnosis begins with a clinical suspicion of
hyperammonemia.7 Typically, patients have normal glucose and electrolyte levels.
Enzymatic diagnosis and/or genetic testing is also available; however, treatment should not
be delayed while waiting for a final diagnosis. Most deaths have occurred during an episode
of acute hyperammonemic encephalopathy.5,6 Treatment includes use of alternative waste
nitrogen excretion pathways (e.g., Buphenyl, Ravicti); other treatments may include
hemodialysis, dietary protein restriction, and, in some cases, essential amino acid
supplementation.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of phenylbutyrate
products. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the
approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with phenylbutyrate products
as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires phenylbutyrate products to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Buphenyl® (sodium phenylbutyrate tablets and powder for oral solution –
Horizon, generic)
• Olpruva® (sodium phenylbutyrate for oral suspension – Acer)
• Pheburane® (sodium phenylbutyrate oral pellets – Medunik)
• Ravicti® (glycerol phenylbutyrate oral liquid – Horizon)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for
FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Urea Cycle Disorders. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ALL of the
following (A, B, C, and D):
Note: Examples of urea cycle disorders include deficiencies of carbamylphosphate
synthetase, ornithine transcarbamylase, or argininosuccinic acid synthetase.
A) According to the prescriber, the diagnosis was confirmed by ONE of the following (i
or ii):
i. Approve for 1 year if genetic or enzymatic testing confirmed a urea cycle
disorder; OR
ii. Approve for 3 months if the patient has hyperammonemia diagnosed with an
ammonia level above the upper limit of the normal reference range for the
reporting laboratory; AND
Note: Reference ranges are dependent upon patient’s age.
B) The medication is prescribed in conjunction with a protein-restricted diet; AND

Authorization Policy
C) Patient will not be receiving concurrent therapy with another phenylbutyrate product;
AND
Note: Examples of phenylbutyrate products that should not be taken concurrently
include sodium phenylbutyrate (Buphenyl, generic), Pheburane, Olpruva, and Ravicti.
D) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a metabolic disease specialist
(or specialist who focuses in the treatment of metabolic diseases).
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Buphenyl® (sodium phenylbutyrate tablets and powder for oral solution –
Horizon, generic)
• Olpruva® (sodium phenylbutyrate for oral suspension – Acer)
• Pheburane® (sodium phenylbutyrate oral pellets – Medunik)
• Ravicti® (glycerol phenylbutyrate oral liquid – Horizon)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other use(s)
including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated
as new published data are available):
1. Concomitant Therapy with Another Phenylbutyrate Product. There are no data
available to support concomitant use.
Note: Examples of phenylbutyrate products include sodium phenylbutyrate, Olpruva,
Pheburane, and Ravicti.
