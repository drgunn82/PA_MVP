INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Pretomanid, a nitroimidazole, is indicated as part of a combination regimen with
Sirturo® (bedaquiline tablets) and linezolid tablets or oral suspension (Zyvox®,
generic) for the treatment of pulmonary extensively drug-resistant or
treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis
(TB) in adults.1 Approval of this indication is based on limited clinical safety and
efficacy data. This drug is indicated for use in a limited and specific population of
patients.
Limitation of use: Pretomanid is not indicated for use in patients with the following
conditions: drug-sensitive TB, latent infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
extra-pulmonary infection due to M. tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant TB that is not
treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive to standard therapy. The safety and
effectiveness of Pretomanid when used with drugs other than Sirturo and linezolid
have not been established.
The prescribing information notes the total duration of treatment with Pretomanid,
Sirturo, and linezolid to be 26 weeks.1 The dosing of the combination regimen can
be extended beyond 26 weeks.2

Policy
Guidelines
The World Health Organization (WHO) issued consolidated guidelines (2022) with
information on the choice and design of regimens for the treatment of drug-resistant
TB, including multidrug- or rifampin-resistant TB and confirmed rifampicin-
susceptible, isoniazid-resistant TB.2 Drug susceptibility tests are recommended to
assist the prescriber in choosing the appropriate initial regimen. In addition, a
surveillance system is recommended to determine the local prevalence of drug-
resistant TB strains. The WHO notes that the duration of treatment is different for
regimens containing different drugs. The duration for regimens containing
Pretomanid, Sirturo, and linezolid range from 6 to 9 months.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Pretomanid.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval
is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Pretomanid as well as
the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Pretomanid to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated.
