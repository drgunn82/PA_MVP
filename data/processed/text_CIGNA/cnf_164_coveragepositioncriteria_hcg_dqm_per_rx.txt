INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Pregnyl, Novarel, and (human) chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are indicated for the
following:1-3
• Prepubertal cryptorchidism not due to anatomical obstruction. hCG is
thought to induce testicular descent in situations when descent would have
occurred at puberty. hCG may help predict whether or not orchiopexy will be
needed in the future. In most cases, descent following hCG use is temporary,
but in some instances, the descent is permanent. hCG therapy is usually
initiated in children between the ages of 4 and 9 years.
• Selected cases of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in males
(hypogonadism secondary to a pituitary deficiency).
• Induction of ovulation and pregnancy in the anovulatory, infertile woman in
whom the cause of anovulation is secondary and not due to primary ovarian
failure, and who has been appropriately pretreated with human menotropins.

Policy – Per Rx
Of note, these hCG products are not indicated for use in assisted reproductive
technology (ART) programs, though they have been consistently used and studied
for this indication.
Dosing and Availability
Table 1. Chorionic Gonadotropin Product Description/Dosing Regimens.1-4
Detail Pregnyl, Novarel, chorionic gonadotropin
Formulation type Urine-derived
Administration IM only
Dosing Prepubertal cryptorchidism dosing options*:
• 4,000 USP units TIW for 3 weeks.
• 5,000 USP units every second day for four injections.
• 15 injections of 500 to 1,000 USP units over a 6-week period.
• 500 USP units TIW for 4 to 6 weeks. If unsuccessful, then another series
starting 1 month later is given using 1,000 USP units per injection.
Selected cases of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in males dosing
options*:
• 500 to 1,000 USP units TIW for 3 weeks, followed by the same dose twice a
week for 3 weeks.
• 4,000 USP units TIW for 6 to 9 months, then 2,000 USP units TIW for an
additional 3 months.
OI dosing*: 5,000 to 10,000 USP units 1 day following the last dose of
menotropins† (a dosage of 10,000 USP units is recommended in the labeling
for menotropins).
Availability Pregnyl: 10,000 USP units/vial of hCG.
Novarel: 5,000 USP units/vial of hCG.
Chorionic gonadotropin: 10,000 USP units/vial of hCG.
Storage Pregnyl: Store at room temperature. Reconstituted solution is stable for 60
days when refrigerated.
Novarel: Store at room temperature. Use reconstituted product within 30
days when refrigerated.
Chorionic gonadotropin: Store at room temperature. Reconstituted
solution is stable for 60 days when refrigerated.
IM – Intramuscular; * The dosage regimen used in any particular patient will depend upon the indication
for the use, the age and weight of the patient, and the physician’s preference. The regimens listed are
from the prescribing information; TIW – Three times a week; OI – Ovulation induction; † following the
last dose of gonadotropins (for Pregnyl); hCG – human chorionic gonadotropin.
Of note, there is another chorionic gonadotropic, Ovidrel (choriogonadotropin alfa
injection [recombinant]), which is also indicated for ovulation induction.
Additionally, it is indicated for induction of final follicular maturation and early
luteinization in infertile women who have undergone pituitary desensitization and
who have been appropriately pretreated with follicle stimulating hormone as part of
an ART program. It is not targeted by this quantity management policy.
POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to promote the safe,
effective, and economic use of the chorionic gonadotropins. If the Drug Quantity
Management rule is not met for the requested medication at the point of service,
coverage will be determined by the Criteria below. All approvals are provided for 1
year in duration, unless otherwise noted below.

Based on the dosing and availability above, six 5,000 USP unit vials (30,000 USP
units) or three 10,000 USP unit vials (30,000 USP units) would provide a quantity
sufficient for 30 days of therapy for most of the recommended dosing regimens for
prepubertal cryptorchidism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in males and it
would also be adequate for the induction of ovulation.
