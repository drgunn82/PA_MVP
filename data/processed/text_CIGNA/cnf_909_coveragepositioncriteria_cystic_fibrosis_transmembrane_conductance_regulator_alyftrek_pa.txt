CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Alyftrek is a combination of deutivacaftor, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
(CFTR) potentiator, tezacaftor, and vanzacaftor. It is indicated for the treatment
of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients ≥ 6 years of age who have at least one F508del
mutation or another responsive mutation in the CFTR gene.1
If the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be
used to confirm the presence of at least one indicated mutation.1
Table 1 lists responsive CFTR mutations based on clinical response, and/or in vitro
data in Fischer Rat Thyroid cells or human bronchial endothelial cells, or based on
extrapolation of efficacy.

CFTR – Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator.
Guidelines
Alyftrek is not addressed in available guidelines. The most current treatment
recommendations are the Standards of Care for CFTR variant-specific therapy for
people with CF, from the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (2023).2 However, the
Standards do not reflect the currently approved age indications for Kalydeco®
(ivacaftor tablets and oral granules) [≥ 1 months of age], Orkambi®
[lumacaftor/ivacaftor tablets and oral granules] (≥ 1 year of age), or Trikafta®
[elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor; ivacaftor tablets and oral granules) [≥ 2 years of
age]. In general, Trikafta is recommended over other agents where indications
overlap. The Standards recommend Trikafta in patients ≥ 6 years of age with CF
who are homozygous or heterozygous for F508del. In patients with one or more
responsive non-F508del variant, Kalydeco, Symdeko® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and
ivacaftor tablets), or Trikafta are recommended. Kalydeco is recommended in
patients ≥ 4 months of age with eligible CFTR gene variants. Orkambi is
recommended for patients 2 to 5 years of age who are homozygous for F508del. Of
note, the Standards state that after diagnosis, repeat sweat testing provides
evidence of treatment effect on CFTR activity, but does not predict clinical
response. The European Cystic Fibrosis Society Standards for establishing and
maintaining health (2024) note that people with CF with eligible CFTR gene variants
should be offered CFTR modulator therapy.5
According to the CF Foundation (2017), CF is diagnosed when an individual has
both a clinical presentation of CF and evidence of CFTR dysfunction.3,4 Clinical
presentation of CF includes a positive newborn screening, signs and/or symptoms
of CF, and/or family history of CF. To establish a diagnosis of CF, sweat chloride
tests should be considered first, then CFTR genetic analysis (CFTR genotype), and
then CFTR physiologic tests (nasal potential difference [NPD] or intestinal current
measurement [ICM]). However, tests of CFTR function are not always done in this
order. All individuals diagnosed with CF should have a sweat chloride test and
CFTR genetic analysis performed.
In a patient with a sweat chloride test ≥ 60 mmol/L, CF diagnosis is established and
in patients with a sweat chloride test < 30 mmol/L, a diagnosis of CF is unlikely.3,4
Rarely, patients with a sweat chloride < 30 mmol/L may be considered to have CF if
alternatives are excluded and other confirmatory tests (genetic and physiologic
testing) support CF. In patients with a sweat chloride test of ≥ 30 to < 60 mmol/L,
CFTR genetic analysis is undertaken. If the genetic analysis identifies two CF-
causing CFTR mutations, CF is diagnosed, if no CFTR mutations are identified, a
diagnosis of CF is unlikely. In patients with a CFTR genotype that is undefined or of
varying clinical consequence, full gene CFTR sequencing (if not already performed)
or CFTR physiologic testing is performed (NPD or ICM). If only one CFTR variant is
identified on limited analysis, full gene CFTR sequencing should be performed. CF
is possible if both alleles possess CF-causing, undefined, or mutation of varying
clinical consequence mutations; CF is unlikely if only no CF-causing mutations are
found. If results of the NPD or ICM show CFTR dysfunction, CF is diagnosed; when
testing is unavailable or equivocal, the diagnosis of CF is not resolved, and when
6 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator –
Alyftrek Prior Authorization Policy
results of the physiologic testing show CFTR function is preserved, a diagnosis of CF
is considered unlikely. It is recommended that patients with challenging diagnoses
be evaluated at an accredited CF Foundation Care Center.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Alyftrek.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Alyftrek as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Alyftrek to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
Alyftrek™ (vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor tablets – Vertex)
