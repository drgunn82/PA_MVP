INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Pyrukynd, a pyruvate kinase activator, is indicated for the treatment of hemolytic
anemia due to pyruvate kinase deficiency in adults.1 It is recommended to
discontinue Pyrukynd if no benefit has been observed by 24 weeks as evaluated by
hemoglobin and hemolysis laboratory results and transfusion requirements.
Dosing
Pyrukynd is administered orally with or without food and must be swallowed whole.1
Tablets cannot be split, crushed, chewed, or dissolved. The recommended initial
dose of Pyrukynd is 5 mg twice daily (BID). The dose should then be titrated from
5 mg BID to 20 mg BID and then to the maximum recommended dose of 50 mg
BID, with dose increases every 4 weeks. The titration schedule is in Table 1. Prior
to increasing to the next dose level, hemoglobin should be assessed. If no benefit

Policy – Per Days
has been observed by 24 weeks, based on hemoglobin and hemolysis laboratory
results and transfusion requirements, discontinue Pyrukynd.
Table 1. Pyrukynd Dose Titration Schedule.1
Duration Clinical Parameters Dose Recommendations
Week 1 through NA 5 mg BID
Week 4
Week 5 through Hemoglobin is below normal range or Increase to 20 mg BID and
Week 8 patient has required a transfusion within maintain for 4 weeks
the last 8 weeks
Hemoglobin is within normal range and Maintain 5 mg BID
patient has not required a transfusion
within the last 8 weeks.
Week 9 through Hemoglobin is below normal range or Increase to 50 mg BID and
Week 12 patient has required a transfusion within maintain thereafter
the last 8 weeks
Hemoglobin is within normal range and Maintain the current dose (i.e.,
patient has not required a transfusion 5 mg BID or 20 mg BID)
within the last 8 weeks.
Maintenance If hemoglobin decreases. Consider up-titration to the
maximum dose of 50 mg BID
NA – Not applicable; BID – Twice daily.
Patients should avoid abrupt interruption or abrupt discontinuation of Pyrukynd to
reduce the risk of acute hemolysis.1 The recommended taper schedule is in Table 2.

5 mg BID 5 mg QD Discontinue NA
20 mg BID 20 mg QD 5 mg QD Discontinue
50 mg BID 50 mg QD 20 mg QD Discontinue
BID – Twice daily; QD – Once daily; NA – Not applicable.
The use of Pyrukynd along with strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A inhibitors or
inducers should be avoided.1 If co-administration with a moderate CYP3A inhibitor
cannot be avoided, monitor hemoglobin and do not titrate Pyrukynd beyond 20 mg
BID. If co-administration with a moderate CYP3A inducer cannot be avoided,
monitor hemoglobin and titrate beyond 50 mg BID, if necessary, but do not exceed
a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg BID. If the patient requires a dose
reduction due to tolerability, an adverse event, or elevated hemoglobin, the dose
may be reduced to the next lower dose level. If Pyrukynd needs to be
discontinued, the taper schedule in Table 2 should be used. However, there are
some situations outlined in the prescribing information when discontinuing
Pyrukynd without a taper may be warranted.
