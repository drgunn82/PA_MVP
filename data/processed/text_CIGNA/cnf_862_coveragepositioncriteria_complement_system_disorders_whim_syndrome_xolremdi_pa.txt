INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Xolremdi, a CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of
WHIM syndrome (warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections and myelokathexis) to
increase the number of circulating mature neutrophils and lymphocytes in adults and
children ≥ 12 years of age.1
Disease Overview
WHIM syndrome is a rare autosomal primary immunodeficiency that causes hyperactivity
with failure to down regulate the CXCR4 receptor.2,3 Most of the patients with WHIM
syndrome are heterozygous carriers of mutations of CXCR4. Clinical presentation includes
recurrent bacterial infections and severe or chronic neutropenia that begins in infancy or
early childhood. There is no cure for WHIM syndrome and prior to the approval of Xolremdi,
treatment was based on patient symptoms.2

Xolremdi Prior Authorization Policy
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Xolremdi. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Xolremdi as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval requires
Xolremdi to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Xolremdi™ (mavorixafor capsules – X4 Pharmaceuticals)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for
FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable):

the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of the following (i, ii, iii,
and iv):
i. Patient is ≥ 12 years of age; AND
ii. Genetic testing confirms pathogenic and or likely pathogenic variants in the
CXCR4 gene; AND
iii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):
a) At baseline, patient had an absolute neutrophil count ≤ 400 cells/µL; OR
b) At baseline, patient had a white blood cell count ≤ 400 cells/µL; AND
iv. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an immunologist,
hematologist or dermatologist; OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Xolremdi. Approve for 1 year if, according to the
prescriber, the patient is continuing to derive benefit from Xolremdi as determined
by the most recent objective measurement.
Note: Examples of objective measurements of a response to Xolremdi therapy are
reduced frequency, duration, or severity of infections, less frequent treatment with
antibiotics, fewer warts, or improved or stabilized clinical signs/symptoms of WHIM
syndrome (e.g., absolute neutrophil count, white blood cell count, and absolute
lymphocyte count).
