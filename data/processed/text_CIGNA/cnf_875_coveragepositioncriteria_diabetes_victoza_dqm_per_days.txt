INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Liraglutide subcutaneous (SC) injection (Victoza, authorized generic), a glucagon-
like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist, is indicated:1
• As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and
pediatric patients ≥ 10 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• To reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events
(cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) in
adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease.
Dosing
Adult Dosing
The recommended initial dose of liraglutide is 0.6 mg administered subcutaneous
(SC) once daily (QD) for 1 week.1 The 0.6 mg QD dose is not effective for glycemic
control in adults; it is intended to be used to reduce gastrointestinal symptoms
during initial titration. Following 1 week of dosing at 0.6 mg QD, the dose should
be increased to 1.2 mg SC QD. After at least 1 week of treatment with 1.2 mg SC
QD, the dose may be increased to the maximum recommended dose of 1.8 mg SC
QD if additional glycemic control is required.

Policy – Per Days
Pediatric Dosing
In pediatric patients ≥ 10 years of age, the recommended initial dose of liraglutide
is 0.6 mg SC QD.1 After 1 week at the current dose, the dose may be increased in
0.6 mg increments if additional glycemic control is required. The maximum
recommended dose is 1.8 mg SC QD.
If the patient misses a dose of liraglutide, they should resume the QD dosing
regimen as prescribed with the next scheduled dose.1 If more than 3 days have
passed since the last dose of liraglutide, it should be reinitiated at the 0.6 mg QD
dose to mitigate any gastrointestinal symptoms associated with treatment
reinitiation. Then, liraglutide should be titrated at the discretion of the healthcare
provider.
