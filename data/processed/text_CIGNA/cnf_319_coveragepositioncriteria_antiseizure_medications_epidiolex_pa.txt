CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Epidiolex, a cannabinoid, is indicated in patients ≥ 1 year of age for the treatment
of seizures associated with:1
• Dravet syndrome.
• Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
• Tuberous sclerosis complex.
Disease Overview
Dravet syndrome is a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy marked with frequent
and/or prolonged seizures.2,3 The seizures generally begin in the first year of life in
an otherwise healthy infant. Affected individuals can develop many seizure types:
myoclonic, tonic-clonic, absence, atypical absence, atonic, focal aware or impaired
awareness (previously called partial seizures), and status epilepticus.3 Two or more
antiseizure medications (ASMs) are often needed to control the seizures; most of the
seizures are refractory to medications. The goals of treatment are cessation of
prolonged convulsions, reduction in overall seizure frequency, and minimization of
treatment side effects.4,5
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe epileptic and developmental encephalopathy, is
associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality.6,7 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome

Policy
most often begins between 3 and 5 years of age.6-9 Affected children experience
several different types of seizures, most commonly atonic seizures (sudden loss of
muscle tone and limpness) and tonic seizures.6,9 The three main forms of treatment
of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are ASMs, dietary therapy (typically the ketogenic diet),
and device/surgery (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation, corpus callostomy).9 None of the
therapies are effective in all cases of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and the disorder has
proven particularly resistant to most therapeutic options.
Tuberous sclerosis complex is a rare, genetic disease that causes non-cancerous
(benign) tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys,
heart, eyes, lungs, and skin.10 It can result in a combination of symptoms including
seizures, impaired intellectual development, autism, behavioral problems, skin
abnormalities, and kidney disease. Seizures affect most individuals with tuberous
sclerosis complex at some point during their life and can be difficult to control.
Clinical Efficacy in Other Refractory Seizures
In 2014, an expanded access program was initiated to provide Epidiolex to patients
with treatment-resistant epilepsy.14 Of the 840 patients included in a published
review, 192 patients were diagnosed with Dravet syndrome or Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome, and 648 patients were diagnosed with other conditions, including CDKL5
deficiency disorder, Dup15q, Aicardi, and Doose syndromes; febrile infection‐related
epilepsy syndromes; focal epilepsy; tuberous sclerosis complex; Sturge‐Weber
syndrome; lissencephaly; cortical malformation/dysplasia; and myoclonic absence.
The patients enrolled in the study had severe, intractable, childhood-onset
treatment-resistant epilepsy and were on stable doses of ASMs for 4 weeks before
starting Epidiolex as add-on therapy. The initial dose of Epidiolex was 2 to 10
mg/kg/day (taken as two divided doses) and gradually titrated until intolerance or to
a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg/day or 50 mg/kg/day, depending upon treatment site.
Of those enrolled in the expanded access program, 892 patients were evaluated and
included in the safety analysis set and 840 patients were included in the efficacy
analysis set. Through 192 weeks, the median percentage reduction in seizure
frequency across visit windows ranged from 50% to 67% for convulsive seizures and
46% to 66% for total seizures. In a cohort of 132 patients (72 children, 60 adults)
with treatment-resistant epilepsy, bi-weekly seizure frequency decreased from a
mean of 144.4 at entry to 52.2 at 12 weeks (P = 0.01) and remained stable
thereafter.15 Of note, patients with a diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or
Dravet syndrome were initially excluded because of preferential enrollment into the
randomized clinical trials; once these trials were closed for enrollment, patients with
these syndromes were also enrolled. In a separate cohort of patients with CDKL5
deficiency disorder and Aicardi, Doose, and Dup15q syndromes (n = 46), the percent
change in median convulsive seizure frequency decreased from baseline to Week 12
by 51.4% and by 59.1% at Week 48.16 There was a significant difference between
the percent changes in monthly convulsive seizure frequency during baseline and
Week 12 (P = 0.00001), with no difference in seizure percent change between Weeks
12 and 48. Of the 55 patients in the safety group, 27% of patients withdrew by Week
144 due to adverse effects (n = 4), lack of efficacy (n = 9), withdrawn consent (n =
1), and lost to follow-up (n = 1).

Guidelines/Recommendations
Dravet Syndrome
At this time, there are three drugs approved for the treatment of seizures associated
with Dravet syndrome: Epidiolex, Diacomit® (stiripentol capsules, powder for oral
suspension), and Fintepla® (fenfluramine oral solution).1,11,17 An expert panel
considers valproic acid and clobazam to be the first-line treatment for Dravet
syndrome.4 If seizure control is suboptimal, Diacomit and topiramate are second-
line treatment. Ketogenic diet is moderately effective and can also be considered
second-line. The Dravet Foundation states that Diacomit, Epidiolex, and Fintepla are
considered first-line agents for the treatment of Dravet syndrome.2 If control is still
inadequate, other therapies to consider are clonazepam, levetiracetam, and
zonisamide.2,4 Sodium channel blockers (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine,
lamotrigine, and phenytoin) can worsen seizures in Dravet syndrome. Additionally,
vigabatrin and tiagabine may increase the frequency of myoclonic seizures and should
be avoided.
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
Currently, the FDA-approved drugs for this condition are Epidiolex, Fintepla,
felbamate, Banzel® (rufinamide tablet, oral suspension), lamotrigine, topiramate, and
clobazam.12 Despite the lack of level I or level II evidence, valproic acid remains a
mainstay in treatment.8,9,13 If valproic acid does not provide adequate seizure
control, which is almost always the case, lamotrigine should be added as the first
adjunctive therapy.7 If the combination regimen of valproic acid and lamotrigine does
not provide adequate control, then Banzel should be initiated and either valproic acid
or lamotrigine should be discontinued. If seizure control is still not achieved, the
next adjunctive therapies to consider are topiramate, clobazam, and felbamate.
There is limited evidence for the use of levetiracetam, zonisamide, and Fycompa®
(perampanel tablet, oral suspension). Where possible, no more than two ASMs should
be used concomitantly; use of multiple ASMs raise the risk of side effects and/or
drug-drug interactions.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Epidiolex. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Epidiolex as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Epidiolex to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
