INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Dichlorphenamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of
primary hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP), primary hypokalemic
periodic paralysis (HypoPP), and related variants.1 These conditions are
heterogeneous and response to dichlorphenamide may vary; therefore, prescribers
should evaluate the patient’s response to dichlorphenamide after 2 months to decide
whether it should be continued.
Disease Overview
The primary periodic paralyses are rare muscle disorders caused by autosomal
dominant genetic mutations in ion channels.2,3 The altered channels cannot properly
regulate the flow of ions into muscle cells, which reduces the ability of skeletal
muscles to contract, leading to severe muscle weakness or paralysis.4 Genetic testing
is recommended as the first diagnostic step; a heterozygous pathogenic mutation
can be identified in 60% to 70% of periodic paralysis cases.5 When a genetic
mutation cannot be identified, periodic paralyses can be distinguished based on
clinical presentation. Other causes of hypokalemia or hyperkalemia should be
excluded.5

Regarding treatment, oral potassium salts can be taken as maintenance/prophylactic
therapy for patients with HypoPP; however, this does not completely prevent
attacks.6 Although data are limited to case reports and single-blind trials,
acetazolamide, another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, has been used historically for
primary periodic paralysis. Acetazolamide treatment is beneficial in approximately
50% of patients with HypoPP and it has no effect in 30% of affected patients. It can
also exacerbate symptoms in 20% of patients. Dichlorphenamide has been reported
to be 30 times more potent than acetazolamide in vitro.7 Prior to initiating
dichlorphenamide it is important to verify if the patient has had exacerbation with
acetazolamide, since dichlorphenamide is considered to be more potent and may
potentially lead to more exacerbations.8
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of
dichlorphenamide. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases
where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of
the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
dichlorphenamide, as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-
term efficacy, initial approval requires dichlorphenamide to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Keveyis® (dichlorphenamide tablets - Xeris,

A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 2 months if the patient meets ALL of the following
(i, ii, iii, iv, v, and vi):
i. Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of primary hypokalemic periodic paralysis
by meeting at least ONE of the following (a, b, or c):
a) Patient has had a serum potassium concentration of less than 3.5 mEq/L
during a paralytic attack; OR
b) Patient has a family history of the condition; OR
c) Patient has a genetically confirmed skeletal muscle calcium or sodium
channel mutation; AND
ii. The prescriber has excluded other reasons for acquired hypokalemia; AND
Note: Examples of other reasons for acquired hypokalemia include renal,
adrenal, or thyroid dysfunction; renal tubular acidosis; and diuretic or
laxative abuse.

iii. Patient has had improvements in paralysis attack symptoms with potassium
intake; AND
iv. Patient has tried oral acetazolamide therapy; AND
v. According to the prescriber, acetazolamide therapy did not worsen the
paralytic attack frequency or severity in the patient; AND
vi. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist or a
physician who specializes in the care of patients with primary periodic
paralysis (e.g., muscle disease specialist, physiatrist); OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Dichlorphenamide. Approve for 1 year if the
patient has responded to dichlorphenamide (e.g., decrease in the frequency or
severity of paralytic attacks) as determined by the prescriber.
