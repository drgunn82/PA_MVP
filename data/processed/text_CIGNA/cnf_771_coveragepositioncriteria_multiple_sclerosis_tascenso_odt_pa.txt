CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Tascenso ODT, a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, is indicated for the
treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically
isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting disease, and active secondary progressive
disease in patients ≥ 10 years of age.1 The FDA-approved dose for pediatric
patients ≥ 10 years of age who weigh less than or equal to 40 kg is 0.25 mg once
daily. For adults and pediatric patients 10 years of age and older weighing more
than 40 kg, the dose is 0.5 mg once daily. Administer Tascenso ODT with or
without water. Place the tablet directly on the tongue and allow it to dissolve before
swallowing. Tascenso ODT is available in 0.25 mg and 0.5 mg orally disintegrating
tablets. Fingolimod doses higher than two times the recommended Tascenso ODT

Receptor Modulator) – Tascenso ODT Prior Authorization Policy
dosage are associated with a greater incidence of adverse events without additional
benefit.
Disease Overview
MS is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating, autoimmune disease of the central
nervous system that impacts almost 1,000,000 people in the US.2-4 The condition
is marked by inflammation and demyelination, as well as degenerative alterations.
Patients usually experience relapses and remissions in their neurological symptoms.
For most patients, the onset of MS symptoms occurs when patients are 20 to 40
years of age; however, children can get MS and new onset disease can occur in
older adults. The MS disease course is heterogeneous but has some patterns.
Approximately 85% to 90% of patients have a relapsing pattern at onset. However,
this transitions over time in patients who are untreated to a worsening with very
few or no relapses or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity (secondary
progressive MS). Around 10% to 15% of patients have a steady progression of
symptoms over time (primary progressive MS), marked by some clinical
manifestations or by MRI activity. Primary progressive MS is generally diagnosed in
patients on the upper level of the typical age range (e.g., almost 40 years of age)
and the distribution is equivalent among the two genders. Advances in the
understanding of the MS disease process, as well as in MRI technology, spurned
updated disease course descriptions in 2013,5 as well as in 2017.6 The revised
disease courses are clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting MS, primary
progressive MS, and secondary progressive MS.2-6 Clinically isolated syndrome is
now more recognized among the course descriptions of MS. It is the first clinical
presentation of MS that displays characteristics of inflammatory demyelination that
may possibly be MS but has yet to fulfill diagnostic criteria. It is notable that the
other MS designations can be further characterized considering whether patients
have active disease (or not active), as well as if disease is worsening or stable.
Disability in MS is commonly graded on the deterioration of mobility per the
Expanded Disability Status Scale an ordinal scale that ranges from 0 to 10, with
higher scores indicating greater disability.
Guidelines
In September 2019, a consensus paper was updated by the MS Coalition that
discusses the use of disease-modifying therapies in MS.2 Many options from
various disease classes, involving different mechanisms of action and modes of
administration, have shown benefits in patients with MS.2
Safety
The initiation of Tascenso ODT leads to decreases in heart rate.1 The first dose of
Tascenso ODT should be given in a setting in which resources to appropriately
manage symptomatic bradycardia are available. Monitor all patients for 6 hours
after the first dose for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly pulse and
blood pressure measurement. Patients with prolonged QTc interval at baseline or
during the 6-hour observation period, or taking medications with known risks of
torsades de pointes, should be observed overnight with continuous
electrocardiographic monitoring in a medical facility. When restarting Tascenso ODT
after discontinuation for more than 14 days after the first treatment month,
Page 2 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Multiple Sclerosis (Oral – Sphingosine 1-Phosphate
Receptor Modulator) – Tascenso ODT Prior Authorization Policy
perform first-dose monitoring. There are several contraindications for use which
mainly include patients with background cardiovascular disease. Tascenso ODT is
associated with serious toxicities such as decreased heart rate and/or
atrioventricular condition after the first dose; an increased risk of infections;
macular edema; pulmonary toxicity; and elevated liver enzymes. Cases of
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy have occurred in patients with multiple
sclerosis who were given fingolimod in the postmarketing setting.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Tascenso
ODT. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Tascenso ODT as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and efficacy,
approval requires Tascenso ODT to be prescribed by or in consultation with a
physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Tascenso ODT® (fingolimod orally disintegrating tablets -
Cycle/Handa)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):

(A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve if the patient meets ALL of the following (i, ii, and
iii):

Note: Examples of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis include clinically
isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting disease, and active secondary
progressive disease.
ii. Patient is ≥ 10 years of age; AND
iii. Medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist or a
physician who specializes in the treatment of multiple sclerosis; OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Tascenso ODT for ≥ 1 Year. Approve if the
patient meets ALL of the following (i, ii, iii, and iv):
i. Patient has a relapsing form of multiple sclerosis; AND

Page 3 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Multiple Sclerosis (Oral – Sphingosine 1-Phosphate
Receptor Modulator) – Tascenso ODT Prior Authorization Policy
Note: Examples include stabilization or reduced worsening in disease
activity as evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [absence
or a decrease in gadolinium enhancing lesions, decrease in the number
of new or enlarging T2 lesions]; stabilization or reduced worsening on
the Expanded Disability State Scale (EDSS) score; achievement in
criteria for No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA)-3 or NEDA-4;
improvement on the fatigue symptom and impact questionnaire-
relapsing multiple sclerosis (FSIQ-RMS) scale; reduction or absence of
relapses; improvement or maintenance on the six-minute walk test or
12-Item MS Walking Scale; improvement on the Multiple Sclerosis
Functional Composite (MSFC) score; and/or attenuation of brain
volume loss.
b) Patient experienced stabilization, slow progression, or improvement in
at least one symptoms such as motor function, fatigue, vision,
bowel/bladder function, spasticity, walking/gait, or
pain/numbness/tingling sensation; AND
iv. Medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist or a
physician who specializes in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Tascenso ODT® (fingolimod orally disintegrating tablets -
Cycle/Handa)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with Other Disease-Modifying Agents Used for Multiple
Sclerosis. These agents are not indicated for use in combination (See Appendix
for examples). Additional data are required to determine if use of disease-
modifying multiple sclerosis agents in combination is safe and provides added
efficacy.
2. Non-Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis. In the INFORMS trial fingolimod
did not slow disease progression in patients with primary progressive multiple
sclerosis.7
Note: An example of a non-relapsing form of multiple sclerosis is primary
progressive multiple sclerosis.
