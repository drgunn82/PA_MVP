INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Vosevi is a direct-acting-antiviral (DAA) containing sofosbuvir, a nucleotide analog
NS5B polymerase inhibitor, velpatasvir, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5A inhibitor, and
voxilaprevir, an HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitor.1 It is indicated for the treatment of
adults with chronic HCV with or without compensated cirrhosis who have:
• Genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection and have previously been treated with
an HCV regimen containing an NS5A inhibitor;
• Genotype 1a or 3 infection and who have previously been treated with an HCV
regimen containing sofosbuvir without an NS5A inhibitor.
Additional benefit of Vosevi over Epclusa® (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir tablets/oral
granules) was not shown in adults with genotype 1b, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection previously
treated with sofosbuvir without an NS5A inhibitor.1 The recommended dosage of
Vosevi is one tablet, taken orally, once daily (QD) with food for 12 weeks.

Guidelines
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidelines recommend
Vosevi in several circumstances in adults, mainly in patients who are direct-acting
antiviral-experienced (outlined below). Some of these recommendations are based
on very limited data and are not FDA-approved indications for Vosevi (e.g.,
retreatment with Vosevi in patients who have failed Vosevi in the past [one case
report]).
Vosevi is recommended in the following situations:
• Genotype 1 through 6 chronic HCV, ± compensated cirrhosis, treatment-
experienced
o Prior sofosbuvir-based treatment failure: Vosevi for 12 weeks; the addition of
ribavirin is recommended in patients with genotype 3 HCV with compensated
cirrhosis.
o Prior Mavyret® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir tablets and oral pellets) treatment
failure: Vosevi for 12 weeks; the addition of ribavirin is recommended in
patients with compensated cirrhosis.
o Prior Zepatier® (elbasvir/grazoprevir tablets) treatment failure: Vosevi for 12
weeks; the addition of ribavirin is recommended in patients with compensated
cirrhosis.
o Prior Vosevi treatment failure: Vosevi + ribavirin for 24 weeks.
• Kidney transplant, genotype 1 through 6 HCV, ± compensated cirrhosis,
treatment-experienced
o Prior direct-acting antiviral failure: Vosevi ± ribavirin for 12 weeks; the
addition of ribavirin should be considered for patients with compensated
cirrhosis and multiple negative baseline characteristics.
• Recurrent HCV post-liver transplantation, genotype 1 through 6 infection
of the allograft, ± compensated cirrhosis, treatment-naïve
o Prior direct-acting antiviral failure: Vosevi for 12 weeks is recommended; the
addition of ribavirin should be considered for patients with compensated
cirrhosis and multiple negative baseline characteristics.
Vosevi is an alternative recommendation in the following situation:
• Genotype 3 HCV, compensated cirrhosis, treatment-naïve with Y93H
resistance-associated substitution
o Vosevi for 12 weeks.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Vosevi. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Vosevi as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and efficacy, approval requires Vosevi to be
prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition
being treated.
