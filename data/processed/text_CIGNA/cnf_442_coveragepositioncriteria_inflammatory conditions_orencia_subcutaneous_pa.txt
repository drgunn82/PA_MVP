CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Orencia subcutaneous, a selective T-cell costimulation modulator, is indicated for the
following uses:1
• Rheumatoid arthritis, in adults with moderately to severely active disease.
• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, in patients ≥ 2 years of age with moderately
to severely active polyarticular disease.
• Psoriatic arthritis, in patients ≥ 2 years of age with active disease.
Per the product labeling, Orencia is not recommended for concomitant use with other
potent immunosuppressants such as biologics or Janus kinase inhibitors.
Guidelines
Orencia is addressed in guidelines for treatment of various inflammatory conditions.
• Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from the American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) [2021] recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted
synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for a patient taking
the maximum tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2
• Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2019) list biologics
among the treatment options for subsequent therapy in patients with
Page 1 of 9 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Orencia Subcutaneous Prior
Authorization Policy
polyarthritis.3 Initial therapy with a biologic may be considered for patients
with risk factors and involvement of high-risk joints (e.g., cervical spine, wrist,
or hip), high disease activity, and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling
joint damage. In patients with active sacroiliitis or enthesitis despite a
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi)
is recommended.
• Psoriatic Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2018) recommend TNFis over other
biologics for use in treatment-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis and in
those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.4 However, Orencia
may be considered over other biologics in patients with recurrent or serious
infections.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Orencia
subcutaneous injection. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In
cases where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with Orencia as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-
term efficacy, initial approval requires Orencia subcutaneous to be prescribed by or
in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Orencia® (abatacept subcutaneous injection (Bristol Myers Squibb)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Orencia® (abatacept subcutaneous injection (Bristol Myers Squibb)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Ankylosing Spondylitis. In an open-label Phase II trial, Orencia was
administered intravenously on Days 1, 15, 29, and every 28 days thereafter to
patients with active ankylosing spondylitis.5 Patients received a fixed dosage of
Orencia of approximately 10 mg/kg based on body weight. The primary endpoint
was a 40% improvement in disease activity at Week 24 in the Assessment of
SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria (ASAS 40). At Week 24, the ASAS
40 was 13.3% (n = 2/15) in TNFi-naïve patients compared with no responses in
patients who had previously failed TNFis (n = 15). ASAS 20 response was 26.7%
(n = 4/15) in TNFi-naïve patients compared with 20% (n = 3/15) in those who
had previously failed TNFis. A major response was not shown with Orencia
treatment.
2. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination
with this medication.
3. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (i.e., Crohn’s Disease, Ulcerative Colitis). In
placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of Orencia intravenous for
induction and maintenance in adults with active, moderate to severe Crohn’s
disease (n = 451) and ulcerative colitis (n = 490), Orencia was no more effective
than placebo.6 Patients were randomized to Orencia 30 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 3
mg/kg (according to body weight) or placebo and dosed at Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 8.
A total of 90 patients with Crohn’s disease and 131 patients with ulcerative colitis
who responded to induction were then randomized to Orencia 10 mg/kg or placebo
every 4 weeks through Week 52. When used for induction of Crohn’s disease,
17.2%, 10.2%, and 15.5% of patients receiving Orencia 30 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg,
and 3 mg/kg, respectively achieved a clinical response at Weeks 8 and 12
compared with 14.4% of patients receiving placebo (P = not significant [NS] for
all comparisons). In patients with Crohn’s disease, response and remission at
Week 52 was not significantly different between the Orencia intravenous and
placebo treatment groups. When used as induction therapy in ulcerative colitis,
21.4%, 19.0%, and 20.3% of patients receiving Orencia 30 mg, 10 mg, and 3
mg/kg, respectively achieved a clinical response at Week 12 compared with
29.5% of patients receiving placebo (P = 0.043 for 10 mg/kg vs. placebo; other
comparisons P = NS). At Week 52, 12.5% (n = 8/64) and 14.1% (n = 9/64) of
9 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Orencia Subcutaneous Prior
Authorization Policy
patients with ulcerative colitis were in remission (P = NS) and 17.2% of patients
in each treatment group (n = 11/64 for each group) had achieved a response.
4. Psoriasis. In the pivotal trial evaluating Orencia subcutaneous for psoriatic
arthritis, there was not a significant difference at Week 24 in the proportion of
patients with a 50% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50)
response vs. placebo ± conventional synthetic DMARD (27% vs. 20% with placebo
± conventional synthetic DMARD; P = NS).8 In a multicenter, Phase I, 26-week,
open-label dose-escalation study, 43 patients with stable plaque psoriasis (10%
to 49% body surface area involvement) received four doses of Orencia given as a
1-hour intravenous infusion on Days 1, 3, 16 and 29.7 The starting dose was 0.5
mg/kg. Four to six patients were accrued to each of eight dose levels: 0.5, 1, 2,
4, 8, 16, 25 and 50 mg/kg. A parallel control group was matched for age and
overall disease severity. In all, 46% of patients on Orencia achieved a 50% or
greater sustained improvement in clinical disease activity (Physician’s Global
Assessment of disease activity) compared with baseline psoriasis evaluation.
Progressively greater effects were observed with the highest doses. Further
studies are needed to establish safety and efficacy, as well as appropriate dosing,
in plaque psoriasis.
Note: Patients with concomitant plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis may be
reviewed under the psoriatic arthritis criteria above.
