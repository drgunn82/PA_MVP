INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Benlysta subcutaneous (SC), a B-lymphocyte stimulator-specific inhibitor, is
indicated for the following uses:1
• Lupus nephritis, in patients ≥ 5 years of age with active disease who are
receiving standard therapy.
• Systemic lupus erythematosus, in patients ≥ 5 years of age with active,
autoantibody-positive, systemic disease who are receiving standard therapy.
Benlysta SC has not been studied and is not recommended in those with severe,
active central nervous system lupus, or in combination with other biologics. In
some of the clinical trials involving Benlysta, Black patients had a lower response
rate for the primary endpoint relative to Black patients receiving placebo; therefore,
caution is recommended when considering Benlysta in Black patients. Of note,
intravenous (IV) Benlysta is not targeted in this policy.
Dosing
Benlysta SC is not approved for use in patients < 5 years of age.1

Management Policy – Per Days
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
• Patients 15 kg to <40 kg: 200 mg SC once every 2 weeks.
• Patients ≥ 40 kg: 200 mg SC once weekly.
• If transitioning from IV Benlysta therapy, administer the first SC dose 1 to 4
weeks after the last IV dose.
Lupus Nephritis
• In adults initiating therapy with Benlysta for active lupus nephritis, the
recommended dose is 400 mg (two 200 mg injections) once weekly, for 4 doses,
then 200 mg once weekly thereafter.
• A patient receiving IV Benlysta therapy may transition to SC therapy any time
after the patient completes the first two IV doses. The recommended SC dose
in this scenario is 200 mg given 1 to 2 weeks after the last IV dose.
Availability
Benlysta SC is available as a 200 mg/mL prefilled syringe and auto-injector.1
