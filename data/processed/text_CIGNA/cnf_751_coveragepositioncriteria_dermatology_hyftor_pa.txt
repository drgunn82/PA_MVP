CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Hyftor, a topical mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor immunosuppressant, is
indicated for the treatment of facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous
sclerosis in patients ≥ 6 years of age.1
Disease Overview
Tuberous sclerosis complex is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by
mutations in two genes, tuberous sclerosis 1 and tuberous sclerosis 2.2-4 The
incidence rate is approximately one in 6,000 to 10,000 births. It is characterized by
non-cancerous (benign) tumors that grow in the brain, as well as in other vital organs
such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. It can also impact the central
nervous system causing seizures, impaired intellectual development, autism, and
behavioral issues. The disease has great variability but can occur when patients are
very young (around 1 year of age). Most patients (up to 80%) experience various
skin conditions due to the disease such as angiofibromas, hypomelanotic macules,
and cephalic plaques. Angiofibromas in the face usually appear in young children
and gradually proliferate thereafter. This manifestation can be serious as well as
disfiguring.
Clinical Efficacy
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Dermatology ( Hyftor Prior Authorization Policy
The efficacy of Hyftor for its approved use was evaluated in one Phase III,
randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter pivotal study conducted in
Japan involving 62 patients who were 6 years of age and older.1,2 The trial enrolled
patients with tuberous sclerosis complex who had three or more facial angiofibromas
that were at least 2 mm in diameter with redness present in each. Patients also had
a definitive diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex. Use of Hyftor reduced the lesion
size and redness of the facial angiofibromas after 12 weeks of use compared with
vehicle.1,2 The assessment at 4 weeks after discontinuation of Hyftor suggests that
continuation of therapy is required for benefit.2 It is recommended that if symptoms
do not improve within 12 weeks of Hyftor treatment, the need for continuing Hyftor
should be reevalauted.1
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Hyftor. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Hyftor as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Hyftor to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
