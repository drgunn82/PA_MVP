INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Emgality, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist, is indicated for the
following uses:1
• Episodic cluster headache treatment in adults.
• Migraine headache prevention in adults.
Migraine headaches have been defined as chronic or episodic. Chronic migraine is
described by the International Headache Society as headache occurring on ≥ 15
days/month for more than 3 months, which has the features of migraine headache
on ≥ 8 days/month.2 Episodic migraine is characterized by headaches that occur <
15 days/month.3 Episodic migraine is more common than chronic migraine;
however, chronic migraine is associated with a markedly greater personal and
societal burden.

Drug Quantity Management Policy – Per Days
Cluster headaches are associated with attacks of severe, strictly unilateral pain,
lasting 15 to 180 minutes.2 The headaches occur from once every other day to
eight times per day. Cluster headache is considered among the most severe of the
primary headache disorders.4 Episodic cluster headache is defined as cluster
headache attacks occurring in periods lasting from 7 days to 1 year, separated by
pain-free periods lasting ≥ 3 months. Typically, episodic cluster periods last
between 2 weeks and 3 months. Chronic cluster headache attacks affect 10% to
15% of patients with cluster headache, lasting for ≥ 1 year without remission, or
with remission periods lasting < 3 months.
Dosing
The recommended dosage of Emgality for preventative treatment of migraine is a
240 mg loading dose (two consecutive subcutaneous [SC] injections of 120 mg
each), followed by 120 mg SC once a month.1 The recommended dosage of
Emgality for episodic cluster headache is 300 mg (three consecutive SC injections
of 100 mg each) at the onset of the cluster period, and then monthly thereafter
until the end of the cluster period.
Availability
Emgality is available as 120 mg/mL single-dose prefilled pens and prefilled syringes
supplied in cartons containing one or two pens or syringes.1 It is also available as
100 mg/mL single-dose prefilled syringes in cartons containing three syringes.
POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to manage potential
dose escalation of Emgality. If the Drug Quantity Management rule is not met for
the requested medication at the point of service, coverage will be determined by
the Criteria below. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. “One-
time” overrides are provided for 30 days in duration.
