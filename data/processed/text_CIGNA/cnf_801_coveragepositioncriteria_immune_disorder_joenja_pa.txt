INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY

CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Joenja, a kinase inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-
kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adults and pediatric patients ≥12 years of
age.1
Disease Overview
APDS is an ultra-rare, genetic, progressive primary immunodeficiency disorder.2,3 It is
estimated to occur in 1 to 2 people per one million. APDS is an autosomal dominant disease
caused by variants in PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes, resulting in hyperactivation of the PI3Kδ
pathway. APDS is characterized by both immune deficiency and dysregulation, which causes
various clinical manifestations, such as recurrent sinopulmonary infections, recurrent
herpesvirus infections, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, nodular lymphoid
hyperplasia, autoimmunity, cytopenias, enteropathy, and bronchiectasis. APDS can lead to
end-organ damage, malignancy, and early mortality. There are no other FDA-approved
treatments for APDS. Current APDS management includes immunosuppressants,
prophylactic antimicrobials, immunoglobulin replacement therapy, sirolimus, hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and surgery or procedures.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Joenja was evaluated in one Phase III, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-
controlled, multicenter, pivotal study in 31 patients with APDS.2 Eligible patients were 12 to
75 years of age, had pathogenic variants in PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes, had clinical findings
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Immune Disorder (Joenja Prior Authorization Policy
consistent with APDS (e.g., history of repeated oto-sino-pulmonary infection and organ
dysfunction), and more than one measurable lymph node on computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging scan. The co-primary outcomes were differences from
baseline in the index lymph node size and the percentage of naïve B cells in peripheral
blood, which are measures of immune dysregulation and deficiency.2 Both co-primary
endpoints were met. Joenja significantly reduced lymphadenopathy and significantly
increased the percentage of naïve B cells. Joenja also improved other outcome measures,
such as spleen size, lymphocyte subsets, cytopenias, and immunoglobulin (Ig)M levels.
Although changes in health-related quality of life measures were not statistically significant,
many patients reported increase in activity and energy levels. An ongoing open label
extension study reported results in an interim analysis from 37 patients with least 5 years of
Joenja exposure.3,4 Joenja demonstrated a reduction in use of immunoglobulin replacement
therapy and a decrease in the annualized yearly infection rate. Continued improvements in
mean index lymph node size; mean immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels; and mean percentages
of naïve B cells and transitional B cells were seen.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Joenja. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Joenja as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires Joenja to
be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.

list of specialists: allergist and otolaryngologist (ear, nose,
and throat [ENT] physician) and the following specialists
were added: gastroenterologist or hematologist for initial
