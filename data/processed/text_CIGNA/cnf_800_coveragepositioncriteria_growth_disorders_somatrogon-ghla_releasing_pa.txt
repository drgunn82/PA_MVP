INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ngenla, a human growth hormone (hGH) product, is indicated for the treatment of
growth failure due to inadequate secretion of growth hormone (GH) in
pediatric patients ≥ 3 years of age.1
Disease Overview
Ngenla is a hGH analog, which is made up of the amino acid sequence of hGH with
an added three copies of the C-terminal peptide of human chorionic gonadotropin.1
The addition of the C-terminal peptides leads to a longer half-life. Ngenla binds to
the GH receptor, which initiates changes in growth and metabolism. In children
with GH deficiency (GHD), somatropin is effective for increasing final adult height.2
Somatropin therapy is recommended to normalize adult height and prevent
extreme shortness in children and adolescents with GHD. In addition to congenital
causes, hypopituitarism may also be caused by radiation therapy; somatropin may
be used to improve final height of children who have undergone radiation.3,4

Guidelines
A consensus statement from international experts was recently published (2025)
regarding long-acting GH therapy.12 The authors note that lonapegsomatropin,
somapacitan, and somatrogon have all demonstrated noninferiority to daily
somatropin for efficacy (i.e., annualized height velocity) in pediatric GHD. They
also state that the safety profile of long-acting products is comparable to that of
daily somatropin. It is noted that given the unique pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic profile and molecular weight of each formulation, the weight-
based dosing calculation is different for each product and direct milligram dose
comparisons are not appropriate.
Some guidelines do not specifically address Ngenla. Neither the Pediatric Endocrine
Society guidelines for children and adolescents with GHD2 (2016) nor the GH
Research Society guidelines on children with short stature11 (2019) recommend a
specific GH product for GHD. Guidelines recommend the use of GH to normalize
adult height and prevent extreme shortness in pediatric patients with GHD.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Ngenla. All
reviews will be directed to a clinician (i.e., pharmacist or nurse) for verification of
criteria. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Ngenla as well as monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy,
initial approval requires the medication to be prescribed by or in consultation with a
physician who specializes in the condition being treated. hGH is FDA-approved for
treatment of a limited number of conditions. The FDA has not approved the use of
hGH as therapy for anti-aging, longevity, or cosmetic or performance enhancement.
Federal law prohibits the dispensing of hGH for non-approved purposes. A
pharmacy’s failure to comply with that law could result in significant criminal
penalties to the pharmacy and its employees. Accordingly, a pharmacy may decline
to dispense prescriptions for hGH when written by a physician or other authorized
prescribers who they believe may be involved in or affiliated with the fields of anti-
aging, longevity, rejuvenation, cosmetic, performance enhancement, or sports
medicine.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Ngenla® (somatrogon-ghla subcutaneous injection - Pfizer)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Athletic Ability Enhancement.5 Somatropin and related agents are not FDA-
approved for athletic performance enhancement or for body building in non-
athletes. Federal law prohibits the distribution or dispensing of somatropin or
related agents for non-FDA approved uses.
2. Central Precocious Puberty (CPP). Children with precocious puberty are often
treated with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (Lupron®
[leuprolide acetate injection]) to suppress pituitary gonadal activity, to slow the
advancement of bone age (prevent premature fusion of the epiphyseal growth
plates), and to improve adult height. In some patients GnRH agonist therapy may
result in marked deceleration of bone velocity and may result in adult height that
is less than the mid-parental height. Small and nonrandomized studies have
demonstrated a significant improvement in final adult height over pre-treated
predicted adult height in patients treated with GnRH agonist and growth hormone
as compared with patients treated with GnRH agonist alone. However, larger
randomized studies are lacking, and routine use of growth hormone in this setting
is not recommended.6,7
3. Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH).8,9 The Endocrine Society clinical
practice guidelines on CAH due to steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency recommend
against the use of experimental treatment approaches outside of formally
approved clinical trials.9 Children with predicted adult height standard deviation
≤ -2.25 may be considered for growth-promoting treatments in appropriately
controlled trials.
4. Constitutional Delay of Growth and Puberty. These children have delayed
skeletal maturation and pubertal development. Administering somatropin does
not increase adult height (which is usually normal).10 Short-term androgen
therapy accelerates growth and the rate of pubertal advancement in boys.
