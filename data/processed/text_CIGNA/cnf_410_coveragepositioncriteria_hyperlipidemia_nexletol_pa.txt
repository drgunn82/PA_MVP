CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Nexletol, an adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase inhibitor, is indicated for the
following uses:1
• To reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary revascularization
in adults who are unable to take recommended statin therapy (including those
not taking a statin) with either: 1) established cardiovascular disease
(CVD), or 2) at high risk for a CVD event but without established CVD.
• Primary hyperlipidemia, including heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), in adults as an adjunct to diet, in combination
with other low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies, or
alone when concomitant LDL-C lowering therapy is not possible, to reduce LDL-
C.
The safety and effectiveness of Nexletol have not been established in pediatric
patients.1
Page 1 of 12- Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hyperlipidemia – Nexletol Prior Authorization Policy
Clinical Efficacy
CLEAR Outcomes was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving
13,970 adults, 18 to 85 years of age who were unable or unwilling to take statins
due to unacceptable adverse events. Patients had or were at high risk for CVD.1,2
Patients without established CVD were considered high risk for CVD based on meeting
at least one of the following: diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2) in females > 65
years of age or males > 60 years of age; a Reynolds Risk score > 30% or a SCORE
Risk score > 7.5% over 10 years; or a coronary artery calcium score > 400 Agatston
units at any time in the past.1 Patients were assigned to receive Nexletol or
placebo.1,2 Use of statins at very low doses were permitted, as well as other lipid
lowering therapies (e.g., ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, fibrates). The mean
patient age was 65 years. In total, 70% of patients had a previous cardiovascular
(CV) event (secondary prevention population), whereas 30% of patients were
categorized as being in the primary prevention group. In total, 38% of patients were
receiving at least one lipid-modifying therapy. At baseline, 23% of patients were
utilizing a statin and 12% of patients were on ezetimibe. The mean LDL-C at baseline
was 139 mg/dL. The median follow-up was 40.6 months. The mean LDL-C level after
6 months of treatment with Nexletol was 107 mg/dL vs. 136 mg/dL for placebo. The
primary endpoint (death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or coronary
revascularization) occurred in 11.7% of patients in the Nexletol group vs. 13.3% of
patients in the placebo group (P = 0.004). The composite endpoint (death from CV
causes, nonfatal stroke, or nonfatal MI) occurred in 8.2% of patients given Nexletol
vs. 9.5% of patients in the placebo group (P = 0.006).
Guidelines
Many guidelines are available regarding the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia.3-
11,17-19 For patients with elevated LDL-C, statins are the cornerstone of therapy and
recommended first-line to be used at maximally tolerated doses due to the
established benefits regarding the reduction of CV risks. Atorvastatin 40 mg to 80
mg once daily (QD) and rosuvastatin 20 mg to 40 mg QD are considered high-
intensity statins as they achieve LDL-C lowering of ≥ 50%.
• The American College of Cardiology (ACC) Expert Consensus Decision
Pathway on the Role of Non-Statin Therapies for LDL-Cholesterol
Lowering in the Management of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease
(ASCVD) Risk (2022) make several recommendations.3 For adults with clinical
ASCVD at very high risk (e.g., patients with major ASCVD events, HeFH,
diabetes) who are on statin therapy for secondary prevention, the general goal
is ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction and an LDL-C < 55 mg/dL (or non-high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C] < 85 mg/dL) with maximally tolerated statin
therapy. If the above goals are not achieved, the initial non-statin agents
recommended include ezetimibe and/or a proprotein convertase subtilisin
kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibody (i.e., Repatha® [evolocumab
subcutaneous injection] or Praluent® [alirocumab subcutaneous injection]).
Nexletol can be considered after these therapies.
• The American Heart Association (AHA)/ACC guidelines on the
management of blood cholesterol (2018) define patients with ACSVD as those
with acute coronary syndrome, those with a history of MI, stable or unstable
angina or coronary or other revascularizations, stroke, transient ischemic
Page 2 of 12 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hyperlipidemia – Nexletol Prior Authorization Policy
attack, or peripheral arterial disease.4,5 An LDL-C < 70 mg/dL is recommended
for most patients with ASCVD to reduce CV risk. Guidelines and reviews have
recognized that patients with an elevated coronary artery calcium or
calcification score (e.g., ≥ 300 Agatston units) are at an increased risk of CV
events.13-16
• The American Diabetes Association Standards of Care for Diabetes
discuss CV disease and risk management (2025).8 For patients with diabetes
who are 40 to 75 years of age at higher CV risk (including those with one or
more ASCVD risk factors), it is recommended to use high-intensity statin
therapy to reduce LDL-C by ≥ 50% of baseline and to target an LDL-C of < 70
mg/dL. Also, for patients with diabetes who are 40 to 75 years of age at higher
CV risk, especially those with multiple ASCVD risk factors and an LDL-C ≥ 70
mg/dL, it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor to a
maximum tolerated statin. In patients with diabetes intolerant to statin
therapy, treatment with Nexletol is recommended to reduce CV event rates as
an alternative cholesterol-lowering plan.
• The ACC/AHA Guideline for the management of Patients with Acute
Coronary Syndrome (ACS) [2025] states that patients who are already on
maximally tolerated statin therapy with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL, adding a non statin
lipid-lowering agent is recommended to further reduce the risk of a major
adverse cardiac event (MACE).17 Some recommendations also provide for a
lower goal LDL-C level (55 to 69 mg/dL).
• Guidelines for Chronic Coronary Disease from the AHA and ACC (along
with other organizations) [2023] state in such patients who are judged to be
at very high risk and on maximally tolerated statin therapy and with an LDL-C
≥ 70 mg/dL, ezetimibe can be beneficial to further reduce the risk of a major
adverse coronary event.9 Patients with chronic coronary disease who are
considered to be at very high risk who have an LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL who are
receiving maximally tolerated statins and ezetimibe, a PCSK9 monoclonal
antibody can be beneficial to further reduce the risk of a major adverse
coronary event. In patients with chronic coronary disease who are on
maximally tolerated statin therapy who have an LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL and in
whom ezetimibe and a PCSK9 monoclonal antibody are not adequate or are
not tolerated, it may be reasonable to add Nexletol.
• The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) clinical
practice guideline on the pharmacologic management of adults with
dyslipidemia (2025) make many recommendations.7 In adults with
dyslipidemia who are receiving maximally tolerated statins and have ASCVD
or who are at an increased risk for ASCVD but who are not at goal (LDL-C <
70 mg/dL), AACE suggests therapy with Praluent or Repatha. In adults with
dyslipidemia who are statin intolerant and have ASCVD or are at increased risk
of ASCVD, AACE suggests use of Nexletol in addition to usual care. In adults
with dyslipidemia who do not have ASCVD and who may tolerate other lipid-
lowering medications, AACE suggests against the use of Nexletol.
• The International Lipid Expert Panel has various position papers on the use
of lipid-lowering therapy that involve Nexletol (2023 and 2024).10,18,19 One
recommendation is that in patients with statin intolerance, Nexletol
monotherapy, or in combination with ezetimibe and other non-statin drugs is
Page 3 of 12 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hyperlipidemia – Nexletol Prior Authorization Policy
recommended to enable patients to achieve therapeutic goals.10 In primary
prevention, Nexletol may be considered for patients at high and very high CV
risk who, despite optimally maximally tolerated doses of statins and ezetimibe,
are not achieving target LDL-C levels.10
• The AHA published a scientific statement regarding familial
hypercholesterolemia (2015).11 Key points are that the condition may start
early (in childhood or adolescence) and is noted by LDL-C levels ≥ 190 mg/dL.
Premature CV disease can result. Diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic
testing. The Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria and Simon Broome criteria may
also be used which incorporate cholesterol levels, family history, clinical
findings, and physical manifestations. Aggressive lipid-lowering therapy is
recommended to achieve LDL-C reductions of at least 50%.11 Other
information also provides guidance on the diagnosis of HeFH.12

Type of Summary of Changes Review
Revision Date
Annual It was added to the Policy Statement that a patient who has 04/26/2023
Revision previously met initial therapy criteria for Nexletol for the requested (criteria
indication under the Coverage Review Department and is currently changes
receiving Nexletol is only required to meet continuation of therapy done with
criteria (i.e., currently receiving therapy). If past criteria has not Selected
Page 9 of 12 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hyperlipidemia – Nexletol Prior Authorization Policy
been met under the Coverage Review Department and the patient Revision
is currently receiving Nexletol, or is restarting Nexletol, initial criteria changes on
must be met. In addition, the following changes were made: 05/03/2023).
Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease: Requirements were
divided to distinguish between initial therapy and patient currently
receiving Nexletol (previously there was only one criteria set). For a
patient who is currently receiving Nexletol and has previously met
initial therapy criteria for the requested indication under the
Coverage Review Department, only the continuation of therapy
criteria has to be met, which was newly developed. The continuation
of therapy criteria states that according to the prescriber, the patient
has experienced a response to therapy with examples provided in a
Note.
Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: Requirements
were divided to distinguish between initial therapy and patient
currently receiving Nexletol (previously there was only one criteria
set). The criteria to confirm the diagnosis of heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia were reworded regarding the use of the Dutch
Lipid Network criteria and the Simon Broome criteria; also, the
phrase “prescriber used” was changed to “the prescriber confirms.”
For a patient who is currently receiving Nexletol and has previously
met initial therapy criteria for the requested indication under the
Coverage Review Department, only the continuation of therapy
criteria has to be met, which was newly developed. The continuation
of therapy criteria states that according to the prescriber, the patient
has experienced a response to therapy with examples provided in a
Note.
Selected Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease: A Note was added that 05/03/2023
Revision a patient may have diagnoses that pertain to more than one
indication, therefore, consider review under different approval
conditions, if applicable.
Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A Note was
added that a patient may have diagnoses that pertain to more than
one indication, therefore, consider review under different approval
conditions, if applicable.
Primary Hyperlipidemia: This was a new indication added under
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence.
Update 01/03/2024: No criteria changes. Updated the wording of the NA
indication.
Selected Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease: Coronary artery 01/17/2024
Revision disease was added as a condition or diagnosis that represents this
indication of use in this related requirement.
Annual Established Cardiovascular Disease: The name of the indication 05/08/2024
Revision was changed to as stated (previously “Atherosclerotic
Cardiovascular Disease”). For Initial Therapy, the requirement that
the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level after treatment with one
high-intensity statin therapy and ezetimibe be ≥ 70 mg/dL was
changed to ≥ 55 mg/dL.
Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: For Initial
Therapy, the requirement that the patient has genetic confirmation
of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia by mutations in the
low-density lipoprotein receptor, apolipoprotein B, proprotein
convertase subtilisin kexin type 9, or low-density lipoprotein
receptor adaptor protein 1 gene was changed to state that the
patient has phenotypic confirmation of heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia and the above examples were moved to a
Note.

Primary Hyperlipidemia: This indication was moved from the
“Other Uses with Supportive Evidence” section to the “FDA-
Approved Indications” section. For Initial Therapy, a patient with
diabetes now qualifies for this indication (if requirements are met);
previously, high risk was only defined as a patient who had a
“coronary artery calcium or calcification score ≥ 300 Agatston units”.
The requirement that the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level
after treatment with one high-intensity statin therapy, along with
ezetimibe, be ≥ 100 mg/dL was changed to ≥ 70 mg/dL.
Selected Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: For Initial 05/28/2025
Revision Therapy, the phrase “phenotypic confirmation of heterozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia” was replaced with “The diagnosis has
been confirmed by genetic testing.” Also, “apo B” was changed to
“APOB.”
