INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Vigabatrin (Sabril, generic) is indicated for the following uses:1-3
• Infantile spasms, as monotherapy, in patients 1 month to 2 years of age for
whom the potential benefits outweigh the potential risk of vision loss.
• Refractory complex partial seizures, as adjunctive therapy, in patients ≥
2 years of age who have inadequately responded to several alternative
treatments and for whom the potential benefits outweigh the risk of vision loss.
Vigabatrin is not indicated as a first-line agent for complex partial seizures.

Authorization Policy
Vigafyde is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of infantile spasms in
pediatric patients 1 month to 2 years of age for whom the potential benefits outweigh
the potential risk of vision loss.4
According to the vigabatrin prescribing information, use the lowest dosage and
shortest exposure to vigabatrin consistent with clinical objectives.1-4 In patients with
infantile spasms, vigabatrin should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not
observed within 2 to 4 weeks. In patients with refractory complex partial seizures,
vigabatrin should be withdrawn if a substantial clinical benefit is not observed within
3 months of initiating treatment.1-3
Safety
Vigabatrin has a Boxed Warning with regard to permanent vision loss.1-4 In some
cases, vigabatrin can also damage the central retina and may decrease visual acuity.
The onset of vision loss from vigabatrin is unpredictable, and can occur within weeks
of starting treatment or sooner, or at any time after starting treatment, even after
months or years. The risk of vision loss increases with increasing dose and cumulative
exposure, but there is no dose or exposure known to be free of risk of vision loss.
Vision assessment is recommended at baseline (no later than 4 weeks after starting
vigabatrin), at least every 3 months during therapy, and about 3 to 6 months after
the discontinuation of therapy. Once detected, vision loss due to vigabatrin is not
reversible. Because of the risk of vision loss, vigabatrin should be withdrawn from
patients with refractory complex partial seizures who fail to show substantial clinical
benefit within 3 months of initiation and within 2 to 4 weeks of initiation for patients
with infantile spasms, or sooner if treatment failure becomes obvious. Because of the
risk of permanent vision loss, vigabatrin is available only through a restricted access
program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Vigabatrin
REMS Program.
Guidelines/Recommendations
In 2012, the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Child Neurology Society
updated the evidence-based guideline for the medical treatment of infantile spasms
(retired April 15, 2024).5 The guidelines note that low-dose adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) is a first-line agent for the short-term treatment of infantile spasms.
ACTH or vigabatrin may be useful for short-term treatment of infantile spasms, with
ACTH considered preferentially over vigabatrin. Hormonal therapy (ACTH or
prednisolone) may be considered for use in preference to vigabatrin in infants with
cryptogenic infantile spasms, to possibly improve developmental outcome. A shorter
lag time to treatment of infantile spasms with either hormonal therapy or vigabatrin
possibly improves long-term developmental outcomes. The Infantile Spasms Working
Group (ISWG) published a US consensus report on infantile spasms in 2010.6 Data
regarding ACTH use and vigabatrin use in infantile spasms were detailed. ACTH is an
effective first-line therapy for infantile spasms. Vigabatrin is considered a drug of first
choice for infantile spasms with concomitant tuberous sclerosis complex, and it is the
drug of second or third choice for children with other symptomatic or cryptogenic
infantile spasms.

Authorization Policy
The AAN and the American Epilepsy Society published a guideline update for
treatment-resistant epilepsy (2018) that notes clobazam is probably effective as add-
on therapy for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and is possibly effective as add-on therapy
for treatment-resistant adult focal epilepsy.7 Vigabatrin is effective as add-on therapy
in treatment-resistant adult focal epilepsy based on two Class I studies, but it should
not be used as a first-line treatment. The benefits of vigabatrin should be weighed
against the risks, particularly the risk of irreversible retinopathy.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of vigabatrin.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval
is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with vigabatrin as well as
the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires vigabatrin to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
