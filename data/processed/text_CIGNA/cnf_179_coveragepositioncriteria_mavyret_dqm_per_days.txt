INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Mavyret, a direct-acting antiviral, contains glecaprevir, a pangenotypic NS3/4A
protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a pangenotypic NS5A inhibitor.1 It is indicated
for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the following scenarios:
• Patients ≥ 3 years of age with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection without
cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A).
• Patients ≥ 3 years of age with genotype 1 infection who previously have
been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A
protease inhibitor, but not both.
Dosing
Duration of Therapy
The duration of therapy is 8, 12, or 16 weeks depending on prior treatment
experience, genotype, and the presence or absence of cirrhosis (see Tables 1 and
2).1 In addition, Mavyret is recommended for 12 weeks in patients ≥ 3 years of
age who are liver or kidney transplant recipients. Similar to non-transplant
recipients, a 16-week treatment duration is recommended in genotype 1-infected
patients who are NS5A inhibitor-experienced without prior treatment with an

NS3/4A protease inhibitor or in genotype 3-infected patients who are treatment-
experienced with regimens containing interferon, pegylated interferon, ribavirin,
and/or Sovaldi® (sofosbuvir tablets/oral pellets).

Regimens containing ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or Daklinza® (daclatasvir tablets) + pegylated interferon +
ribavirin [unapproved regimen] were studied.
Dosing
The recommended dose of Mavyret for adults and pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of
age or in pediatric patients who weigh ≥ 45 kg, is three tablets (total daily dose:
glecaprevir 300 mg and pibrentasvir 120 mg) taken once daily (QD) with food.1 The
recommended dosing for patients 3 to < 12 years of age is weight-based given QD
and is outlined in Table 1. The Mavyret oral pellets are recommended for use in
patients 3 to < 12 years of age or < 45 kg. Mavyret tablets are intended for use in
patients ≥ 12 years of age or pediatric patients ≥ 45 kg. In pediatric patients who
are ≥ 45 kg and unable to swallow tablets, six of the 50 mg/200 mg packets of oral
pellets may be used.
