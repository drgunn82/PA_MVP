INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED.
FOR EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A
COVERAGE POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN
THE COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE
APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION
OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS
TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND
OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
The ribavirin products included in this Prior Authorization policy are indicated for
use in combination with pegylated interferons or interferon for the
treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in adults and children with
compensated disease. Ribavirin remains a component of some regimens for the
management of HCV; however, there is no role for interferon (specifically non-
pegylated interferon) in the management of HCV.2 The specific indications vary
slightly among the oral ribavirin products:
• Ribavirin capsules are indicated in combination with PegIntron®
(peginterferon alfa-2b injection [obsolete]) or Intron A® (interferon alfa-2b
injection [obsolete]) for the treatment of chronic HCV in patients ≥ 3 years of
age with compensated liver disease.1
• Ribavirin tablets are indicated in combination with Pegasys® (peginterferon
alfa-2a) for the treatment of patients ≥ 5 years of age with chronic HCV with

Products) Prior Authorization Policy
compensated liver disease who have not previously been treated with
interferon alfa, and in adults with chronic HCV co-infected with human
immunodeficiency virus.7
Ribavirin is an antiviral agent with direct antiviral activity in tissue culture against
many RNA viruses.1 Ribavirin increases the mutation frequency in the genomes of
several viruses and ribavirin triphosphate inhibits HCV polymerase in a biochemical
reaction.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, oral ribavirin has been
used off-label to treat other systemic viral infections including, but not limited to,
Lassa fever5,6, Nipah virus12, West Nile virus13, and Crimean Congo hemorrhagic
fever.4,11 In addition, oral ribavirin has a place in therapy for the management of
respiratory syncytial virus in transplant recipients.3
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of ribavirin.
The intent of this Prior Authorization program is to ensure ribavirin is not used in
the absence of pegylated interferon or a direct-acting antiviral for the treatment of
HCV. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients being treated
with ribavirin, as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and efficacy,
approval requires ribavirin (for hepatitis C indications) to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• ribavirin tablets (generic)
• ribavirin capsules (generic)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)

ii. The medication is prescribed in combination with a direct-acting antiviral
for HCV; AND
Note: Examples of direct-acting antivirals for HCV include but are not
