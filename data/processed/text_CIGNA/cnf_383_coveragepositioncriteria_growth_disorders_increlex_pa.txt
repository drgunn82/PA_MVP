INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Increlex, an insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), is indicated for the treatment of growth
failure in pediatric patients ≥ 2 years of age with the following conditions:1
• Primary IGF-1 deficiency, for patients with severe disease, defined as:
o Height standard deviation score ≤ -3.0; AND
o Basal IGF-1 standard deviation score ≤ -3.0; AND
o Normal or elevated growth hormone level.
• Growth hormone gene deletion, in patients who have developed neutralizing
antibodies to growth hormone.
Increlex is given by subcutaneous injection twice daily, shortly before or after a meal or
snack. Treatment with Increlex should continue until the epiphyses fuse indicating full
growth potential has been achieved.2 It is a limitation of use that Increlex is not a substitute
to growth hormone for approved growth hormone indications. Increlex is not indicated in
secondary forms of IGF-1 deficiency, such as growth hormone deficiency, malnutrition,
hypothyroidism, or chronic treatment with pharmacologic doses of anti-inflammatory
corticosteroids.1
POLICY STATEMENT
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Growth Disorders – Increlex Prior Authorization Policy
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Increlex. Because of
the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Increlex
as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Increlex to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
• Increlex® (mecasermin [rDNA origin] subcutaneous injection - Ipsen)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for
FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Insulin-Like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) Deficiency – Severe, Primary Disease.
Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ONE of the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy or Patient Has Been on Increlex < 1 Year. Approve if the patient
meets ALL the following (i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, and vii):
i. Patient is ≥ 2 years of age; AND
ii. The epiphyses are open; AND
iii. Height standard deviation score is ≤ -3.0 at baseline; AND
iv. Basal IGF-1 standard deviation score is ≤ -3.0 at baseline; AND
Note: Baseline is prior to initiation of treatment with Increlex. Reference ranges
for IGF-1 vary among laboratories and are dependent upon age, gender, and
puberty status.
v. Growth hormone concentration is normal or increased at baseline; AND
vi. Patient will not be receiving concurrent treatment with growth hormone; AND
vii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a pediatric
endocrinologist.
B) Patient Has Been Receiving Increlex for ≥ 1 Year. Approve if the patient meets ALL
the following (i, ii, and iii):
i. Patient’s height has increased by ≥ 2 cm/year in the most recent year; AND
ii. The epiphyses are open; AND
iii. Patient will not be receiving concurrent treatment with growth hormone.
2. Growth Hormone Gene Deletion. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ONE of the
following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy or Patient Has Been on Increlex < 1 Year. Approve if the patient
meets ALL the following (i, ii, iii, iv, and v):
i. Patient is ≥ 2 years of age; AND
ii. The epiphyses are open; AND
iii. Patient has developed neutralizing antibodies to growth hormone; AND
iv. Patient will not be receiving concurrent treatment with growth hormone; AND
v. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a pediatric
endocrinologist.
B) Patient Has Been Receiving Increlex for ≥ 1 Year. Approve if the patient meets ALL

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Increlex® (mecasermin [rDNA origin] subcutaneous injection - Ipsen)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for ANY other use(s)
including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated
as new published data are available):
1. Idiopathic Short Stature. Increlex has not been fully evaluated for this indication.
Small studies have suggested some patients may respond to IGF-1 therapy3; however,
patients with idiopathic short stature also respond to somatropin. Somatropin
(monotherapy) is indicated for idiopathic short stature4 and there is insufficient evidence
to determine the risks and benefits of Increlex for this indication.
2. Growth Hormone Deficiency. Increlex is not a substitute to somatropin for approved
somatropin uses and is not indicated for use in patients with secondary forms of IGF-1
deficiency, such as growth hormone deficiency.1
