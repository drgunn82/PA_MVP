CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Hympavzi, a tissue factor pathway inhibitor antagonist, is indicated for routine
prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients ≥ 12
years of age with 1) hemophilia A (congenital Factor VIII deficiency) without Factor
VIII inhibitors, and 2) hemophilia B (congenital Factor IX deficiency) without Factor
IX inhibitors.1
Hympavzi is recommended to be given as a 300 mg loading dose by subcutaneous
injection (two 150 mg subcutaneous injections).1 One week after the loading dose,
initiate maintenance dosing of 150 mg once weekly by subcutaneous injection on the
same day each week, at any time of the day. After proper training, Hympavzi may
be self-administered.
Disease Overview
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hemophilia – Non-Factor Routine Prophylaxis Products –
Hympavzi Prior Authorization Policy
Hemophilia A and B are genetic bleeding disorders caused by a dysfunction or a
deficiency of coagulation Factor VIII and Factor IX, respectively.2-7 Because
hemophilia is an X-linked condition, males are primarily impacted. Patients who have
these types of hemophilias are not able to properly form clots in the blood and may
bleed for a longer time than normal following injury or surgery. Patients may also
experience spontaneous bleeding in muscles, joints, and organs. Bleeds may be life-
threatening. A main morbidity is hemophilic arthropathy, which limits mobility. It is
estimated that 33,000 males are living with hemophilia in the US; hemophilia A
accounts for around 80% of the cases (approximately 26,400 patients) and
hemophilia B comprises 20% of cases (around 6,600 patients). Hemophilias are
often classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on reduced Factor VIII or IX
levels. Approximately 50% and 30% of patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia
B, respectively, have severe disease. The formation of antibodies (or inhibitors) to
factor products is a challenging complication as it causes Factor VIII and Factor IX
therapies to be ineffective, which increases bleeding frequency and severity.
Antibodies develop in around 30% and 10% of patients with severe hemophilia A and
hemophilia B, respectively.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Hympavzi.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Hympavzi as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Hympavzi to be prescribed by or in consultation with a hemophilia specialist.
