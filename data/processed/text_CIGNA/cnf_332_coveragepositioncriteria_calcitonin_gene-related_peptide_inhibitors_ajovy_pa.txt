INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE

COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ajovy, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist, is indicated for the
preventive treatment of migraine in adults and the preventive treatment of
episodic migraine in pediatric patients who are 6 to 17 years of age and who
weigh ≥ 45 kg.1
Disease Overview
Migraines have been defined as chronic or episodic. Chronic migraine is described
by the International Headache Society as headache occurring on ≥ 15 days/month
for > 3 months and has the features of migraine headache on ≥ 8 days/month.2
Episodic migraine is characterized by headaches that occur < 15 days/month.3,4
Episodic migraine is more common than chronic migraine; however, chronic migraine
is associated with a markedly greater personal and societal burden.

Guidelines
An updated assessment of the preventive and acute treatment of migraine by
the American Headache Society (AHS) [2018; update 2021] reaffirms previous
migraine guidelines.5,6 Patients with migraine should be considered for preventive
treatment in the following situations: when attacks significantly interfere with
patients’ daily routines despite acute treatment; frequent attacks (≥ 4 monthly
headache days); at least moderate disability (Migraine Disability Assessment
[MIDAS] score ≥ 11 or six-item Headache Impact Test [HIT-6] score > 50);
contraindication to, failure, overuse, or adverse events with acute treatments; or
patient preference. Before developing a preventive treatment plan, the appropriate
use (e.g., drug type, route and timing of administration, frequency) of acute
treatments should be initiated and coupled with education and lifestyle modifications.
All patients with migraine should be offered a trial of acute treatment. Based on the
level of evidence for efficacy and the American Academy of Neurology scheme for
classification of evidence, the following oral treatments have established efficacy and
should be offered for migraine prevention: antiepileptic drugs (divalproex sodium,
valproate sodium, topiramate [not for women of childbearing potential without a
reliable method of birth control]); beta-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol,
timolol); and frovatriptan (for short-term preventive treatment of menstrual
migraine). The following treatments are probably effective and should be considered
for migraine prevention: antidepressants (amitriptyline, venlafaxine); beta-
blockers (atenolol, nadolol); and angiotensin receptor blockers (candesartan).
The AHS issued an update to their position statement (2024) specifically regarding
therapies targeting CGRP for the prevention of migraine.7 The evidence for the
efficacy, tolerability, and safety of CGRP-targeting migraine preventive therapies
(specifically, the monoclonal antibodies: Aimovig [erenumab-aooe subcutaneous
{SC} injection], Ajovy® [fremanezumab-vfrm SC injection], Emgality®
[galcanezumab-gnlm SC injection], and Vyepti® [eptinezumab-jjmr intravenous
infusion], and the gepants: Nurtec® ODT [rimegepant orally disintegrating tablets]
and Qulipta® [atogepant tablets]) is substantial and consistent across different
individual CGRP-targeting treatments. Extensive “real-world” clinical experience
corroborates clinical trials. This data indicates that the efficacy and tolerability of
CGRP-targeting therapies are equal to or greater than those of previous first-line
therapies. The CGRP-targeting therapies should be considered as a first-line
approach for migraine prevention along with previous first-line treatments without a
requirement for prior failure of other classes of migraine preventive treatment.
Additionally, Botox® (onabotulinumtoxinA SC injection) is considered a first-line
therapy for prevention of chronic migraine.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Ajovy® (fremanezumab-vfrm subcutaneous injection – Teva)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Acute Treatment of Migraine. Ajovy has not been studied for the acute
treatment of migraine.
2. Cluster Headache, Treatment or Prevention. Ajovy has not been found to be
effective in Phase III clinical trials in patients with episodic and chronic cluster
headache.7
3. Concurrent Use with Another Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP)
Inhibitor Being Prescribed for Migraine Headache Prevention.
