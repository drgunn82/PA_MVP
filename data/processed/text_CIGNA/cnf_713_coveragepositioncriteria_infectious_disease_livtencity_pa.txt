INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Livtencity, a protein kinase inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of post-transplant
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/disease that is refractory to treatment (with or
without genotypic resistance) with ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, or foscarnet in
patients ≥ 12 years of age (weighing ≥ 35 kg).1 Co-administration of Livtencity with
ganciclovir or valganciclovir is not recommended; Livtencity may antagonize the antiviral
activity of these agents.
CMV infection is a common complication of hematopoietic-cell and solid-organ
transplantation and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.2 The available
antiviral agents (valganciclovir tablets or oral solution, ganciclovir injection, cidofovir
injection, and foscarnet injection) are effective but use is limited by their toxic effects. In
addition, approximately 5% to 14% of transplant recipients develop infection with drug-
resistant CMV, which is associated with poor outcomes.

Policy
In the pivotal study (SOLSTICE), patients were treated with Livtencity (or another
medication) for up to 8 weeks.1 However, in clinical practice, CMV treatment does not
follow a fixed duration and is usually continued until resolution of CMV DNAemia on 1 or 2
consecutive weekly CMV polymerase chain reactions (PCRs).4 Furthermore, resistant and
refractory CMV infections can occur; resistant CMV infection is defined as detection of a
known viral genetic mutation(s) that decrease susceptibility to one or more anti-CMV
medications, whereas refractory CMV is characterized by persistent signs and symptoms of
CMV disease or persistent CMV DNAemia.3 Finally, some patients may experience disease
relapse. Refractory or relapsed CMV disease may all warrant treatment past 8 weeks.
Monitoring CMV viral load is important for identifying cure or the emergence of possible
resistance. CMV viral loads are often drawn at weekly intervals.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Livtencity. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Livtencity as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires Livtencity
to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
