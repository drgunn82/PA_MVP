INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT
PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN
CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Pegfilgrastim, a leukocyte growth factor, is indicated to decrease the incidence of
infection as manifested by febrile neutropenia, in patients with non-myeloid
malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a
clinically significant incidence of febrile neutropenia.1-5,11,12
Fulphila, Fylnetra, Nyvepria, Stimufend, Udenyca, and Ziextenzo are biosimilars to
Neulasta.1-5,11,12 Neulasta is additionally indicated to increase survival in patients
acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation (Hematopoietic
Subsyndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome).1
Guidelines
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Colony Stimulating Factors – Pegfilgrastim Products Prior
Authorization Policy
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) addresses the use of
pegfilgrastim products in several guidelines.
• Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: Guidelines (version 1.2023 – March
31, 2023) recommend pegfilgrastim for hematopoietic cell mobilization for
autologous donors in combination with other treatments.6 Currently, there is
no recommendation for use of pegfilgrastim for stem cell mobilization in
allogeneic donors.
• Hematopoietic Growth Factors: Guidelines (version 2.2023 – March 6,
2023) recommend pegfilgrastim, along with other colony stimulating factors
(CSFs), for prophylactic use if the patient is receiving anti-cancer medications
that are associated with a high (> 20%) incidence of severe neutropenia with
fever.7 Consider CSF therapy for patients with an intermediate (10% to 20%)
probability of developing febrile neutropenia based on risk factors. The NCCN
guidelines also recommend therapy with CSFs in other scenarios in those given
myelosuppressive chemotherapy.
The American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guidelines for the use of
white blood cell growth factors (2015) recommends CSFs to reduce the risk of febrile
neutropenia in patients receiving cancer chemotherapy.8 CSFs may be considered in
patients receiving radiation therapy alone if prolonged delays secondary to
neutropenia are expected. The guidelines state CSFs should be avoided in patients
receiving concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy, particularly involving the
mediastinum.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of
pegfilgrastim. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases
where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because
of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
pegfilgrastim as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, approval requires pegfilgrastim to be prescribed by or in consultation with a
physician who specializes in the condition being treated.

• Fulphila™ (pegfilgrastim-jmdb subcutaneous injection ( Mylan)
• Fylnetra® (pegfilgrastim-pbbk subcutaneous injection ( Kashiv)

FDA-Approved Indications
1. Cancer in a Patient Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy. Approve
for 6 months if the patient meets the following (A and B):
A) Patient meets ONE of the following (i, ii, or iii):
i. Patient is receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer medications that are
associated with a high risk of febrile neutropenia (the risk is at least 20%
based on the chemotherapy regimen); OR
ii. Patient meets both of the following (a and b):
a) Patient is receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer medications that are
associated with a risk of febrile neutropenia, but the risk is less than
20% based on the chemotherapy regimen; AND
b) Patient has at least one risk factor for febrile neutropenia according to
the prescriber; OR
Note: Examples of risk factors include age ≥ 65 years; prior
chemotherapy or radiation therapy; persistent neutropenia; bone
marrow involvement by tumor; recent surgery and/or open wounds;
liver and/or renal dysfunction; poor performance status; or human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
iii. Patient meets both of the following (a and b):
a) Patient has had a neutropenic complication from prior chemotherapy
and did not receive prophylaxis with a colony stimulating factor; AND
Note: Examples of colony-stimulating factors include filgrastim
products, pegfilgrastim products, and sargramostim products (e.g.,
Leukine).
b) A reduced dose or frequency of chemotherapy may compromise
treatment outcome; AND
B) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an oncologist or
hematologist.
2. Radiation Syndrome (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation
Syndrome). Approve for 1 month if the agent is prescribed by or in consultation
with a physician who has expertise in treating acute radiation syndrome.
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
3. Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Transplantation (PBPC) in Patients with
Cancer. Approve one dose if prescribed by or in consultation with an oncologist,
a hematologist, or a physician who specializes in transplantation.
