INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Glyxambi, Qtern, Steglujan, and Trijardy XR are sodium glucose co-transporter-2
inhibitor (SGLT-2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor combination
products indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in
adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus; Trijardy XR also contains metformin.1-4
Various single-entity SGLT-2 inhibitors and DPP-4 inhibitors are available. In
addition to their indications for type 2 diabetes, Jardiance® (empagliflozin tablets),
Invokana® (canagliflozin tablets), and dapagliflozin (Farxiga®, authorized generic)
possess indications related to cardiovascular, renal, and/or heart failure benefits.

Efficacy of the SGLT-2/DPP-4 inhibitor combination products has not been
established in these settings. Refer to Table 1 for a summary of the available

GUIDELINES
The American Diabetes Association Standards of Care (2025) note that therapy for
patients with type 2 diabetes depends on comorbidities, patient-centered treatment
factors, and management needs..5 The SGLT-2 inhibitors (with demonstrated
6 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Diabetes – Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter-2 and
Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors Step Therapy Policy
benefit) are recommended as initial therapy when pertinent comorbidities are
present (atherosclerotic CV disease, or high CV risk, CKD, and heart failure),
independent of metformin use. In pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes,
metformin is the initial treatment of choice if HbA is < 8.5%; if glycemic goals are
1c
no longer met, Jardiance may be considered in children ≥ 10 years of age (the
updated cage indications for dapagliflozin and Invokana are not addressed). DPP-4
inhibitors do not carry indications for cardiorenal benefit and have lower glycemic
efficacy than metformin.
Because type 2 diabetes is a progressive disease, maintenance of glycemic goals
often requires combination therapy. Traditional recommendations have called for
the use of stepwise addition of medications to metformin to maintain glycemic
goals. Metformin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment
(estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and in patients
with acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or
without coma.6
Initial combination therapy should be considered in people presenting with HbA
1c
levels 1.5% to 2.0% above their individualized goal. Incorporation of high-
glycemic-efficacy therapies or therapies for cardiorenal risk reduction (e.g.,
glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists, dual GLP-1/GIP agonists, and SGLT-2 inhibitors)
may reduce the need for agents that increase the risks of hypoglycemia and weight
gain or are less well tolerated.
POLICY STATEMENT
This program has been developed to encourage the use of a Step 1 Product prior to
