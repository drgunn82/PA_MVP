INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.

CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Available single-entity hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase
inhibitors (HMGs) include lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin,
fluvastatin, fluvastatin extended-release, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, Altoprev,
Ezallor Sprinkle, and Zypitamag; combination products are available as well.1-14 All
of the HMGs are indicated as an adjunct to diet for patients with primary
hypercholesterolemia and/or mixed dyslipidemia (to impact lipid parameters
such as to reduce elevated total cholesterol [total-C] and low-density lipoproprotein
cholesterol [LDL-C]). Several agents have additional indications, including those
related to improvement in cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Flolipid (simvastatin oral
suspension) is available and it has the same indications as simvastatin tablets.15
Atorvaliq is an oral suspension that has the same indications as atorvastatin
tablets.16 Ezallor Sprinkle has administration options for patients who cannot
swallow an intact capsule whole.3 The contents can be opened and sprinkled over
soft food (e.g., applesauce, pudding). Also, Ezallor Sprinkle capsules can be
opened and administered by a nasogastric tube.
Guidelines
In November 2013, the American College of Cardiology and the American
Heart Association published guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to
reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in adults17 with an
update published in 2019.18 The guideline emphasizes the appropriate intensity of
statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. No statin is preferred, but instead,
statins with related doses are categorized as “high-intensity” (lowers low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] by approximately ≥ 50%), moderate-intensity
(lowers LDL-C by approximately 30% to < 50%), and low-intensity (lowers LDL-C
by < 30%). Only atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are categorized as acceptable
“high-intensity” statin therapies. According to the guidelines, clinical trial evidence
clearly shows that ASCVD events are reduced by using the maximum-tolerated
statin intensity in groups shown to benefit (e.g., those at risk). There is relatively
less evidence for non-statin medications in reducing ASCVD risk. Table 1
categorizes the different statin regimens as high-, moderate-, and low-intensity.
Refer to the guideline for the most appropriate intensity for the individual patient.

* Used in the randomized controlled trials reviewed by the expert panel. Of note, individual responses
to statin therapy varied in the randomized controlled trials and should be expected to vary in clinical
practice. There might be a biologic basis for a less-than-average response; LDL-C – Low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol; † Evidence from one randomized controlled trial only and down titration is
recommended if the patient is unable to tolerate atorvastatin 80 mg; ‡ Although simvastatin 80 mg was
assessed in randomized controlled trials, initiation of simvastatin 80 mg or titration to 80 mg is not
recommended by the FDA due to the increased risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis; BID – Twice
daily.
POLICY STATEMENT
This program has been developed to encourage the use of a Step 1 Product prior to
the use of a Step 2 Product. If the Step Therapy rule is not met for a Step 2
Product at the point of service, coverage will be determined by the Step Therapy
criteria below. All approvals are provided for 1 year in duration.
Note: When compliance with the Affordable Care Act, Health Resources and
Services Administration Guidelines, and Public Health Services Act section 2713 is
required and the conditions for coverage listed under the Criteria are not met,
approval is granted when the requested single-entity drug is used for the primary
prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in an adult aged 40 to 75 years who has
one or more CVD risk factors (i.e., dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or
smoking) and an estimated 10-year CVD event risk of 10% or greater and who
does NOT have a history of (or signs or symptoms of) CVD and, according to the
prescriber, the alternative Step 1 Products would not be as medically appropriate
for the patient as the requested single-entity drug.
Step 1: atorvastatin, atorvastatin/amlodipine, ezetimibe/simvastatin, fluvastatin,
fluvastatin extended-release, lovastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin,
rosuvastatin, simvastatin
Step 2: Altoprev, Atorvaliq, Caduet, Crestor, Ezallor Sprinkle, Flolipid, Lescol XL,
Lipitor, Livalo, Pravachol, ezetimibe and rosuvastatin (brand product),
Roszet, Vytorin, Zocor, Zypitamag
Hydroxy-Methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitors Step Therapy
Policy product(s) is(are) covered as medically necessary when the
following step therapy criteria is(are) met. Any other exception is
considered not medically necessary.
CRITERIA
1. If the patient has tried one Step 1 Product, approve a Step 2 Product.
2. If the patient cannot swallow or has difficulty swallowing tablets or capsules,
approve Atorvaliq, Flolipid, or Ezallor Sprinkle.
