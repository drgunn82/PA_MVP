ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Pyrimethamine tablets (Daraprim, generic), a folic acid antagonist, are indicated for
the treatment of toxoplasmosis when used conjointly with a sulfonamide, since
synergism exists with this combination.1
Pyrimethamine tablets are considered to be the most effective drug against
toxoplasmosis and are a standard component of therapy.2 Leucovorin, a folinic
acid, protects the bone marrow from the toxic effects of pyrimethamine and is
prescribed in conjunction with pyrimethamine.
Guidelines
The Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in
Adults and Adolescents with Human Immunodeficiency (HIV) [last updated
September 2023] recommend pyrimethamine tablets as the drug of choice for
treatment and chronic maintenance treatment (secondary prophylaxis) of
Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis.3 Pyrimethamine tablets are recommended as an
option for: primary prophylaxis of Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis; primary
prophylaxis and secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance treatment) of
Pneumocystis pneumonia; and secondary prophylaxis (chronic maintenance
treatment) and treatment of cystoisosporiasis (formerly isosporiasis). The drug of
choice for these conditions is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of
pyrimethamine tablets. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with pyrimethamine tablets as well as the monitoring required for adverse
events and long-term efficacy, approval requires pyrimethamine tablets to be
prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition
being treated.
