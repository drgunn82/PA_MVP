CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Kerendia, a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (nsMRA), is indicated
to reduce the risk of:1
• Sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, end-stage
kidney disease, cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and
hospitalization for heart failure (HF) in adults with chronic kidney disease
(CKD) associated with type 2 diabetes; and
• CV death, hospitalization for HF, and urgent HF visits in adults with HF with
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%.
Per the prescribing information, do not initiate treatment with Kerendia if serum
potassium is > 5.0 mEq/L.1 Additionally, initiation of Kerendia is not recommended
in patients with eGFR < 25 mL/min/1.73 m2. Kerendia labeling includes a Warning
Page 1 of 7 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Non-Steroidal Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist –
Kerendia Prior Authorization Policy
regarding hyperkalemia and notes that the risk increases with decreasing kidney
function. Monitoring of serum potassium and eGFR is recommended.
Clinical Efficacy
FIDELIO-DKD (n = 5,734) and FIGARO-DKD (n = 7,352), two published Phase III,
placebo-controlled trials, assessed the efficacy of Kerendia in adults with diabetic
kidney disease.2,8 All patients were required to be treated with an angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) at the
maximum tolerated labeled dose for ≥ 4 weeks prior to the run-in visit. Additionally,
patients were required to have a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of ≥ 30 mg/g,
in addition to other renal entry criteria. FINEARTS-HF, a published Phase III, placebo-
controlled, event-driven trial evaluated Kerendia in adults with HF (New York Heart
Association Class II to IV) with LVEF ≥ 40% (n = 6,001).12 Patients continued their
HF medications; approximately 14% of patients were taking a sodium glucose co-
transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor at baseline.
Guidelines
Diabetes and CKD
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care (2025) recommend
Kerendia for patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD with albuminuria who are
receiving maximum tolerated doses of ACE inhibitors or ARBs, to improve CV
outcomes and reduce the risk of CKD progression.3 In individuals with type 2 diabetes
and CKD, Kerendia is recommended to reduce the risk of hospitalization for HF.
Additionally, in the section regarding CKD , it is noted that in patients with type 2
diabetes and CKD, use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor with demonstrated benefit (if eGFR is
≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2) or a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist with demonstrated
benefit is recommended to reduce CKD progression and CV events. Kerendia (if eGFR
is ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2) is recommended to reduce CV events and CKD progression
in patients with CKD and albuminuria.
The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline
for Diabetes Management in CKD (2022) suggests use of Kerendia in patients with
type 2 diabetes with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2, normal serum potassium, and
albuminuria (≥ 30 mg/g) despite maximal tolerated doses of a renin-angiotensin-
aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor.4 The addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonist (MRA) to current standard of care, including ACE inhibitor or ARB, has
been proven to reduce albuminuria in patients with diabetes and CKD. Kerendia
reduces albuminuria and the risk of kidney and CV outcomes. The guideline also notes
that Kerendia is most appropriate for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at high
risk of CKD progression and CV events, because Kerendia can be added to an
ACE/ARB and an SGLT-2 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and CKD.
A consensus report from the ADA/KDIGO (2022) for diabetes management in CKD
states that Kerendia is recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes, eGFR ≥ 25
mL/min/1.73 m2, normal serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria
(albumin:reatinine ratio ≥ 30 g/g) despite a maximum tolerated dose of RAAS
inhibitor therapy.10
7 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Non-Steroidal Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist –
Kerendia Prior Authorization Policy
The KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD
(2024) reaffirms the statements in the KDIGO 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for
Diabetes Management in CKD.4,13 In addition, the following points are made
regarding Kerendia in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD: Kerendia is most
appropriate for those who are at high risk of CKD progression and CV events with
persistent albuminuria despite other standard-of-care therapies; and Kerendia may
be added to a RAAS inhibitor and an SGLT-2 inhibitor for the treatment of type 2
diabetes and CKD.
Heart Failure
The FINEARTS-HF trial data for Kerendia in HF have not yet been incorporated into
current HF guidelines. However, guidelines recognize that Kerendia has demonstrated
benefit in reducing HF outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD.
Two SGLT-2 inhibitors (Farxiga® [dapagliflozin tablets, authorized generic] and
Jardiance® [empagliflozin tablets]) have demonstrated a significant reduction in the
composite of CV death and hospitalization for HF among patients with HF with LVEF
> 40% (encompassing HF with preserved ejection fraction [HFpEF] and HF with mildly
reduced ejection fraction [HFmrEF]). Both agents are recommended for all patients
with HFpEF and HFmrEF.6,9,11 Inpefa® (sotagliflozin tablets), an SGLT-2 and sodium
glucose co-transporter-1 inhibitor, is indicated to reduce the risk of CV death,
hospitalization for HF, and urgent HF visits in adults with HF14; however, the agent
has not been incorporated into recommendations for HFpEF or HFmrEF.6,9,11 Current
guidelines recommend dapagliflozin or Jardiance for all patients with HFpEF or
HFmrEF, unless contraindicated. The most current recommendations are
summarized below.
The American College of Cardiology (ACC) Expert Consensus Decision Pathway for
HFpEF (2023) recommends dapagliflozin or Jardiance for all patients with HFpEF to
reduce CV death and hospitalization for HF as well as improve health status unless
contraindicated.9 In patients with LVEF < 55% to 60%, use of an MRA, angiotensin
neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), or ARB (when an ARNI is not feasible) may be considered
(ACE inhibitors are not a reasonable alternative).
A 2023 Focused Update of the 2021 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines
for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic HF (developed by the Task
Force for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic HF of the ESC with the
special contribution of the HF Association of the ESC) recommends dapagliflozin or
Jardiance to reduce the risk of hospitalization for HF or CV death in patients with
HFmrEF or HFpEF.11 In addition, the management of both HFmrEF or HFpEF includes
diuretics for symptom management. Additional therapies for HFmrEF may include an
ACE inhibitor/ARNI/ARB, MRA, and/or a beta-blocker. Patients with HFpEF may be
additionally managed with agents aimed at treating the cause(s) of HFpEF as well as
CV and non-CV comorbidities.
The ACC/American Heart Association/HF Society of America Guidelines for the
Management of HF (2022) note that SGLT-2 inhibitors are beneficial to decrease
hospitalization for HF and CV mortality in patients with HFpEF.9 MRA, ARB, and/or
7 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Non-Steroidal Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonist –

ARNI may be considered to decrease hospitalization in selected patients, especially
those with LVEF < 50%.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Kerendia® (finerenone tablets – Bayer)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Hypertension (Treatment). Kerendia has not been evaluated for use in
essential hypertension and is not mentioned in the American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelines (2017).7
Spironolactone and eplerenone are cited as secondary agents for management of
hypertension and are noted to be common add-on therapies for resistant
hypertension. Primary agents include thiazide diuretics, angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers.
Note: For a patient with concomitant chronic kidney disease associated with type
2 diabetes and hypertension, refer to FDA-Approved Indication.

Kerendia Prior Authorization Policy
2. Concomitant Use with Spironolactone or Eplerenone. Spironolactone and
eplerenone are steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Based on their
mechanism of action, an increase in adverse events (e.g., hyperkalemia) would
be expected if used concomitantly with Kerendia. Concomitant spironolactone or
eplerenone use with Kerendia was not permitted in clinical trials.1,5,8,12
