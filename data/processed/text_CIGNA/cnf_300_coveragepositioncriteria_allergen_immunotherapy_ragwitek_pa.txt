OVERVIEW
Ragwitek, a ragweed pollen allergen extract, is indicated as immunotherapy for the
treatment of patients 5 to 65 years of age with short ragweed pollen-induced allergic
rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis confirmed by a positive skin test or in vitro test for
pollen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies for short ragweed pollen.1 Ragwitek is
not indicated for the immediate relief of allergy symptoms. Ragwitek is dosed once daily
and must be initiated at least 12 weeks before the expected onset of ragweed pollen season
and continued throughout the season.
Clinical Efficacy
Clinical trials of Ragwitek enrolled adults and pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis with or
without conjunctivitis. Patients had their diagnosis confirmed by a positive skin prick test
and positive in vitro testing for serum IgE antibodies for short ragweed.1-4
