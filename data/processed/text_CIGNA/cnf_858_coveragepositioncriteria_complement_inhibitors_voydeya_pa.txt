INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Voydeya, a complement Factor D inhibitor, is indicated as add-on therapy to
eculizumab intravenous infusion (Soliris®, biosimilars) or Ultomiris® (ravulizumab-
cwvz intravenous infusion) for the treatment of extravascular hemolysis in
adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).
Limitation of use: Voydeya has not been shown to be effective as monotherapy and
should only be prescribed as an add-on to eculizumab or Ultomiris.
Disease Overview
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, genetic disorder of
hematopoietic stem cells.2,3 The mutation in the X-linked gene phosphatidylinositol
glycan class A (PIGA) results in a deficiency in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)
protein, which is responsible for anchoring other protein moieties to the surface of
the erythrocytes. Loss of anchoring of these proteins causes cells to hemolyze and

Authorization Policy
leads to complications such as hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and peripheral blood
cytopenias. PNH is a clinical diagnosis that should be confirmed with peripheral blood
flow cytometry to detect the absence or severe deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins
on at least two lineages.2,5 Prior to the availability of complement inhibitors, only
supportive management, in terms of managing the cytopenias and controlling
thrombotic risk were available. Supportive measures include platelet transfusion,
immunosuppressive therapy for patients with bone marrow failure, use of
erythropoietin for anemias, and aggressive anticoagulation.
Safety
Voydeya has a Boxed Warning about serious infections caused by encapsulated
bacteria.1 Voydeya is only available through a restricted access program, Voydeya
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Voydeya. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Voydeya as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Voydeya to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.

ii. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria diagnosis was confirmed by
peripheral blood flow cytometry results showing the absence or deficiency
of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins on at least two cell
lineages; AND

infusion (Soliris, biosimilars) or Ultomiris (ravulizumab-cwvz intravenous
infusion); AND

Authorization Policy
Note: Examples of objective laboratory findings include reduction in
hemoglobin levels, elevated reticulocyte counts, increased transfusion
requirements, transfusion-dependence.

Note: Examples of benefit include increase in or stabilization of hemoglobin
levels, decreased transfusion requirements or transfusion independence,
reductions in hemolysis, improvement in Functional Assessment of Chronic

Revision Receiving Voydeya: Criterion regarding patient with clinically
significant extravascular hemolysis (while receiving Soliris or
Ultomiris) was revised to remove “as defined by hemoglobin
level ≤ 9.5 g/dL and absolute reticulocyte count ≥ 120 x 109/L”
and the qualifiers “According to the prescriber” and “as
evidenced by objective laboratory findings” were added.
Examples of objective laboratory findings were added as a Note.
Annual Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria: Biosimilars to 05/21/2025
Revision Soliris were added to criteria where only Soliris was previously
noted; Ultomiris subcutaneous injection was removed from
criteria since the manufacturer has decided not to market the
product.
Conditions Not Covered
