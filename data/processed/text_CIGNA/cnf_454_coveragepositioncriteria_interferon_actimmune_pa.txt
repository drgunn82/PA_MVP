REVIEW DATE: 05/14/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Actimmune, an interferon gamma, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), to reduce the frequency and severity of
serious infections.
• Severe, malignant osteopetrosis (SMO), to delay time to disease progression.
In both disorders, the exact mechanism(s) by which Actimmune has a treatment effect has
not been established. Changes in superoxide levels during Actimmune therapy do not
predict efficacy and should not be used to assess patient response to therapy.
Disease Overview
Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)
CGD, a primary immune deficiency disease, is caused by defects in the nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAPDH) oxidase (NOX) enzyme.2,3 This enzyme is needed
by phagocytes (a type of white blood cell) to kill certain types of bacteria and fungi. Patients
with CGD are at risk of contracting recurrent and sometimes severe bacterial or fungal
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Interferon – Actimmune Prior Authorization Policy
infections. Patients may need lifelong regimens of antibiotics and antifungals to prevent
infections and use of Actimmune may also help reduce the number of severe infections.
Mutations in one of five different genes that encode components of the NADPH (CYBA,
CYBB, NCF1, NCF2, or NCF4) cause CGD. Some patients with CGD do not have an identified
mutation in any of these genes and the cause of the condition in these individuals is
unknown.
The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and the American College of
Allergy, Asthma and Immunology have jointly accepted responsibility for establishing the
practice parameter for the diagnosis and management of primary immunodeficiency.4 The
practice parameter (2015) recommends patients with CGD be given antibacterial and
antifungal prophylaxis and Actimmune.
Severe, Malignant Osteopetrosis (SMO)
SMO is an inherited disorder characterized by osteoclast defect and deficient phagocyte
oxidative metabolism.1 There is a reduction in osteoclastic bone reabsorption, which results
in bone density overgrowth and poor structural integrity (i.e., bones are more brittle and
susceptible to fracture).5,6 In some cases, this is also accompanied by skeletal
abnormalities.5 The cause of SMO is unknown in some patients, however, variants in one of
the following genes have been found to be associated with osteopetrosis: CA2, CLCN7,
IKBLG, ITGB3, LRP5, OSTM1, PLEKHM1, SNX10, TCIRG1, TNFRSF11A, TNFSF11. The
Osteopetrosis Working Group developed expert consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and
management of osteopetrosis (2017).7 The guidelines recommend determination of
diagnosis by classic radiographic (X-ray) features of osteopetrosis followed by genetic
testing to differentiate between the different forms of osteopetrosis with unique
complications. The guidelines suggest the use of Actimmune to be considered experimental
in non-infantile osteopetrosis with limited clinical experience. Furthermore, the guidelines
acknowledge the FDA indication for SMO and advise that the indication pertains only to
severe infantile osteopetrosis.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Actimmune.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated
with Actimmune as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, approval requires Actimmune to be prescribed by or in consultation with a
physician who specializes in the condition being treated. All approvals are provided for the
duration noted below.
• Actimmune® (interferon gamma-1b subcutaneous injection – Horizon)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for
FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Chronic Granulomatous Disease. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets BOTH of the
following (A and B):
A) Diagnosis has been established by a molecular genetic test identifying a gene-related
pathogenic variant linked to chronic granulomatous disease; AND
Note: Examples of gene-related pathogenic variants linked to chronic granulomatous
disease include biallelic pathogenic variants in CYBA, CYBB, NCF1, NCF2, and NCF4.

B) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an immunologist, a
hematologist, or an infectious disease specialist.
2. Malignant Osteopetrosis, Severe Infantile. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
BOTH of the following (A and B):
A) Diagnosis has been established by ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Patient has had radiographic (X-ray) imaging demonstrating skeletal features
related to osteopetrosis; OR
ii. Patient has had a molecular genetic test identifying a gene-related pathogenic
variant linked to severe, infantile malignant osteopetrosis; AND
Note: Examples of gene-related pathogenic variants linked to osteopetrosis
include CA2, CLCN7, IKBLG, ITGB3, LRP5, OSTM1, PLEKHM1, SNX10, TCIRG1,
TNFRSF11A, and TNFSF11.
B) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an endocrinologist.
