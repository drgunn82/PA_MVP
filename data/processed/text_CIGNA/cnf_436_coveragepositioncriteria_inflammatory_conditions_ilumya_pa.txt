REVIEW DATE: 06/04/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ilumya, an interleukin (IL)-23 blocker, is indicated for the treatment of moderate to
severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or
phototherapy.1 It is administered subcutaneously at Weeks 0 and 4 and then once
every 12 weeks thereafter. Ilumya should be administered by a healthcare
professional. Safety and efficacy have not been established in patients < 18 years of
age.
Guidelines
Joint guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology and National Psoriasis
Medical Board (2019) have been published for management of psoriasis with
biologics.2 These guidelines list Ilumya as a monotherapy treatment option for
patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Guidelines from the European
Dermatology Forum (2025) recommend biologics (including Ilumya) as second-line
therapy for most patients requiring systemic treatment when there is inadequate

Policy
response, contraindication, or intolerance to conventional systemic agents (e.g.,
methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin).3
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Ilumya.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with Ilumya as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-
term efficacy, initial approval requires Ilumya to be prescribed by or in consultation
with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated. All approvals are for
the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is authorized in months, 1
month is equal to 30 days.
• Ilumya® (tildrakizumab-asmn subcutaneous injection – Sun)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Plaque Psoriasis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of the
following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 3 months if the patient meets ALL of the following
(i, ii, and iii):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):
a) Patient has tried at least one traditional systemic agent for psoriasis for
at least 3 months, unless intolerant; OR
Note: Examples of one traditional systemic agent include methotrexate,
cyclosporine, or acitretin tablets. A 3-month trial of psoralen plus
ultraviolet A light (PUVA) also counts. An exception to the requirement
for a trial of one traditional systemic agent for psoriasis can be made if
the patient has already had a 3-month trial or previous intolerance to at
least one biologic other than the requested drug. A biosimilar of the
requested biologic does not count. Refer to Appendix for examples of
biologics used for plaque psoriasis. A patient who has already tried a
biologic for psoriasis is not required to “step back” and try a traditional
systemic agent for psoriasis.
b) Patient has a contraindication to methotrexate, as determined by the
prescriber; AND
iii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a dermatologist; OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Ilumya. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
ALL of the following (i, ii, and iii):
i. Patient has been established on therapy for at least 3 months; AND
Note: A patient who has received < 3 months of therapy or who is
restarting therapy is reviewed under criterion A (Initial Therapy).

Policy
ii. Patient experienced a beneficial clinical response, defined as improvement
from baseline (prior to initiating the requested drug) in at least one of the
following: estimated body surface area, erythema, induration/thickness,
and/or scale of areas affected by psoriasis; AND
iii. Compared with baseline (prior to initiating the requested drug), patient
experienced an improvement in at least one symptom, such as decreased
pain, itching, and/or burning.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Ilumya® (tildrakizumab-asmn subcutaneous injection – Sun)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination
with this medication.
