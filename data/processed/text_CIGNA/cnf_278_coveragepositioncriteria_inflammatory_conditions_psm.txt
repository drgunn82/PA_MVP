INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
The following Coverage Policy applies to health benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Certain Cigna
Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make coverage
determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and coverage determinations do not apply to those
clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered
by Cigna Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service
Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan
document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based.
For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a
Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supersedes the information in
the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately
determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance
require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any
applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the
specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical
directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment where appropriate and have discretion in making individual
coverage determinations. Where coverage for care or services does not depend on specific circumstances,
reimbursement will only be provided if a requested service(s) is submitted in accordance with the relevant criteria
outlined in the applicable Coverage Policy, including covered diagnosis and/or procedure code(s). Reimbursement is
not allowed for services when billed for conditions or diagnoses that are not covered under this Coverage Policy (see
"Coding Information" below). When billing, providers must use the most appropriate codes as of the effective date
of the submission. Claims submitted for services that are not accompanied by covered code(s) under the applicable
Coverage Policy will be denied as not covered. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health
benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment
guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other
coverage determinations.
Cigna National Formulary Coverage:
OVERVIEW
Several products are available for use in inflammatory conditions such as
rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic
arthritis, plaque psoriasis, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis.1-25 This policy
involves the use of the products listed above.
The FDA-approved indications for each product listed in this policy are documented
in Appendix A. For more information on criteria within a Prior Authorization
program by specific condition refer to the respective standard Prior Authorization
Policy.
POLICY STATEMENT
For all medications, this program requires the patient to meet the respective
standard Prior Authorization Policy criteria. Additionally, this program requires
trial(s) of the Preferred Product(s) according to the table below, when clinically
appropriate, prior to the approval of the Non-Preferred Products. There are also
75 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions Preferred Specialty Management
Policy for National Preferred, High Performance, and Basic Formularies – Choice/Alternate
situations when trials of Non-Preferred Products will be considered; see criteria
below. Other details of the program are as follows:
• Continuation of Therapy: Approval for a patient continuing therapy with a
Non-Preferred subcutaneous or oral Product must be supported with
verification, noted in the criteria as either [verification in prescription claims
history required] or, if not available, as [verification by prescriber
required].
o If the patient has at least 130 days of prescription claims history on file,
claims history must support that the patient has received the Non-Preferred
Product for the specified period of time (90 or 120 days) within a 130-day
look-back period; OR
o When 130 days of the patient’s prescription claim history file is unavailable
for verification, the prescriber must verify that the patient has been receiving
the Non-Preferred Product for a specified period of time (90 or 120 days),
AND that the patient has been receiving the Non-Preferred Product via paid
claims (e.g., patient has not been receiving samples or coupons or other
types of waivers in order to obtain access to the Non-Preferred Product).
o For a patient continuing therapy, other conditions may also apply. Refer to
criteria below.
• Approval Duration: All approvals for continuation of therapy for Preferred and
Non-Preferred Products are provided for 1 year unless noted otherwise below.
In cases where the initial approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to
30 days.
Documentation: When documentation is required, the prescriber must provide
written documentation supporting the trials of these other Products, noted in the
criteria as [documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not
limited to, chart notes, prescription claims records, and/or prescription receipts.
