INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Fluconazole (Diflucan, generic), a triazole antifungal, is indicated for the following
uses:1
• Vaginal candidiasis, as a treatment for vaginal yeast infections due to
Candida.
• Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis as treatment.
• Cryptococcal meningitis.
• Prophylaxis to decrease the incidence of candidiasis, in patients
undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic
chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Management Policy – Per Rx
In small, non-comparative studies, fluconazole was also effective for the treatment
of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections
including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.1
Dosing
For vaginal candidiasis, the recommended dose of fluconazole is 150 mg as a
single, oral dose.1 Therefore, two tablets (refer to Quantity Limit table below) are
sufficient to treat two episodes of vaginal candidiasis.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for sexually transmitted
infections (2021) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the
management of candidiasis (2016), recommend fluconazole 150 mg orally x 1 dose
as a prescription treatment option for vulvovaginal candidiasis.2,3 For severe
vulvovaginal candidiasis (e.g., extensive vulvar erythema, edema, excoriation, and
fissure formation), the recommended regimen is 150 mg of fluconazole given in two
or three sequential doses (given 72 hours apart). Additionally,
immunocompromised patients may require one dose every third day for a total of 3
doses (7 days); however, prolonged treatment up to 14 days may be required.2
For recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, usually defined as three or more episodes of
symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis in less than 1 year, guidelines recommend
either fluconazole 100 mg, 150 mg, or 200 mg once every 72 hours (Days 1, 4, and
7) to attempt mycologic remission prior to initiating a maintenance antifungal
regimen.2 The indicated maintenance regimen is oral fluconazole 100 mg, 150 mg,
or 200 mg once weekly (QW) for 6 months. Overrides to the standard quantity
limit are provided for these situations.
Fluconazole has been used off-label, to treat various tinea infections (e.g., tinea
pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis, tinea manuum, tinea capitis, onychomycosis, and
pityriasis versicolor [formerly tinea versicolor]).4-6 For most tinea infections, a dose
of 150 mg QW is recommended. However, a dose of 300 mg QW has been used for
pityriasis versicolor. The recommended duration of therapy also varies by specific
indication, but generally, 2 to 6 weeks of therapy are required. For onychomycosis,
150 mg to 450 mg QW for 3 months (fingernail) or 6 to 12 months (toenail) is
used.5. Once weekly dosing at 150 mg for up to 4 weeks has also been used for
intertrigo (also referred to as cutaneous candidiasis) and Candida folliculitis.4,5
Other FDA-approved and off-label indications for fluconazole, such as Candida
urinary tract infections, Coccidioidomycosis, Cryptococcal meningitis,
Histoplasmosis, and oropharyngeal/esophageal candidiasis require doses other than
150 mg and other strengths of fluconazole tablets (i.e., 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg)
or oral solution should be used. There are no quantity limits on the other strengths
of the fluconazole tablets.
Availability
Oral fluconazole (Diflucan, generic) is available as 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and
200 mg tablets.1 A 10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL oral suspension is also available. Of
note, only the 150 mg tablets are targeted in this policy. No quantity limits apply
to the other strengths/dosage forms of fluconazole.
