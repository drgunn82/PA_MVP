DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Valtoco, a benzodiazepine, is indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent,
stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute
repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients
with epilepsy ≥ 6 years of age.1
Valtoco is for acute treatment only. Do not use more than two doses of Valtoco to
treat a single episode.1 It is recommended that Valtoco be used to treat no more
than one episode every 5 days and no more than five episodes per month.
Disease Overview
Patients with epilepsy can experience acute repetitive seizures or seizure clusters.2
Patients with severe and/or poorly controlled epilepsy are more likely to experience
seizure clusters. Seizure clusters can result in increased emergency room visits or
hospitalization, and they can disrupt the daily life, studies, and work of patients and
caregivers. They are particularly concerning because of their association with status
epilepticus, a potentially life-threatening condition. Benzodiazepine rescue
medication is the primary acute therapy for management of seizure clusters, helping
to abort clusters and reduce emergency department visits.
