DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Lagevrio is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits SARS-CoV replication by viral
mutagenesis.1 It was issued Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of
mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high risk for progressing to
severe COVID-19, including hospitalization and death, and for whom alternative
COVID-19 treatment options approved or authorized by the FDA are not accessible
or clinically appropriate.
Lagevrio limitations of authorized use include the following:1
• Lagevrio is not authorized for use in patient < 18 years of age.
• Lagevrio is not authorized for initiation of treatment in patients hospitalized
due to COVID-19. Benefit of treatment has not been observed when
treatment was initiated after hospitalization due to COVID-19.
• Lagevrio is not authorized for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis for
prevention of COVID-19.
• Lagevrio is not authorized for use longer than 5 consecutive days.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Drug Quantity Management Policy – Per Days
Paxlovid contains nirmatrelvir tablets (a SARS-CoV-2 [severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2] main protease inhibitor) co-packaged with ritonavir
tablets (a cytochrome P450 [CYP]3A inhibitor).2 Paxlovid is FDA-approved for the
treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adults who
are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or
death. Paxlovid is not approved for use as pre-exposure or post-exposure
prophylaxis for prevention of COVID-19.
Of note, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that early
reinfection with the COVID-19 virus (within 30 days of the original infection) is
possible and is most often mild, but severe illness may occur.3,4 The CDC does not
provide information regarding retreatment with Paxlovid or Lagevrio. The CDC also
refers to the Infectious Diseases Society of America Guidelines on the Treatment
and Management of Patients with COVID-19 and the American College of Physician
Clinical Guidelines and Recommendations on COVID-19, neither of which comment
on retreatment of reinfections.
Dosing
The recommended dose is as follows:1,2
• Paxlovid: 300 mg nirmatrelvir (two 150 mg tablets) with 100 mg ritonavir (one
100 mg tablet), with all three tablets taken together twice daily (BID) for 5
days. Nirmatrelvir must be co-administered with ritonavir. Failure to correctly
co-administer nirmatrelvir with ritonavir may result in plasma levels of
nirmatrelvir that are insufficient to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.
o Renal impairment: No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild
renal impairment. In patients with moderate renal impairment, the
recommended dose of Paxlovid is 150 mg nirmatrelvir (one 150 mg tablets)
with 100 mg ritonavir (one 100 mg tablet) BID for 5 days. Use of Paxlovid is
not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment.
• Lagevrio: 800 mg (four 200 mg capsules) taken orally once every 12 hours for
5 days.
Treatment with Paxlovid or Lagevrio should be initiated as soon as possible after
diagnosis of COVID-19 and within 5 days of symptom onset. Completion of the full
5-day treatment course and continued isolation in accordance with public health
recommendations are important to maximize viral clearance and minimize
transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Should a patient require hospitalization after starting
treatment, the patient may complete the full 5-day treatment course per the
healthcare provider’s discretion.
Availability
Paxlovid is supplied in two different dose-packs (cartons)2:
• Carton containing 30 tablets divided in five daily-dose blister cards. Each daily
blister card contains four nirmatrelvir 150 mg tablets and two ritonavir 100 mg
tablets.
