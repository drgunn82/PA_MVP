CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Kalydeco, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator,
is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients ≥ 1 month of age
who have one mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to Kalydeco based on
clinical and/or in vitro assay data.1
In patients with unknown genotype, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used
to detect the presence of the CFTR mutation followed by verification with bidirectional
sequencing when recommended by the mutation test instructions for use.1 Kalydeco
is not effective in patients with CF who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in
the CFTR gene. A patient must have at least one CFTR mutation responsive to
Kalydeco to be indicated. Table 1 lists mutations that are responsive to Kalydeco
based on 1) a positive clinical response and/or 2) in vitro data in Fischer rat thyroid
cells indicating that Kalydeco increases chloride transport to ≥ 10% over baseline (%
of normal).

CFTR – Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.
Guidelines
The most current treatment recommendations are the Standards of Care for CFTR
variant-specific therapy for people with CF, from the European Cystic Fibrosis Society
(2023).2 However, the Standards do not reflect the currently approved age
indications for Kalydeco (≥ 1 months of age), Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor tablets
and oral granules) [≥ 1 year of age], or Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor;
ivacaftor co-packaged tablets and oral granules) [≥ 2 years of age]. In general,
Trikafta is recommended over other agents where indications overlap. The Standards
recommend Trikafta in patients ≥ 6 years of age with CF who are homozygous or
heterozygous for F508del. In patients with one or more responsive non-F508del
variant, Kalydeco, Symdeko® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor; ivacaftor tablets), or Trikafta are
recommended. Kalydeco is recommended in patients ≥ 4 months of age with eligible
CFTR gene variants. Orkambi is recommended for patients 2 to 5 years of age who
are homozygous for F508del. Of note, the Standards state that after diagnosis, repeat
sweat testing provides evidence of treatment effect on CFTR activity, but does not
predict clinical response. The European Cystic Fibrosis Society Standards for
establishing and maintaining health (2024) note that people with CF with eligible
CFTR gene variants should be offered CFTR modulator therapy.6
According to the CF Foundation (2017), CF is diagnosed when an individual has both
a clinical presentation of CF and evidence of CFTR dysfunction.4,5 Clinical presentation
of CF includes a positive newborn screening, signs and/or symptoms of CF, and/or
family history of CF. To establish a diagnosis of CF, sweat chloride tests should be
considered first, then CFTR genetic analysis (CFTR genotype), and then CFTR
physiologic tests (nasal potential difference [NPD] or intestinal current measurement
[ICM]). However, tests of CFTR function are not always done in this order. All
individuals diagnosed with CF should have a sweat chloride test and CFTR genetic
analysis performed.
In a patient with a sweat chloride test ≥ 60 mmol/L, CF diagnosis is established and
in patients with a sweat chloride test < 30 mmol/L, a diagnosis of CF is unlikely.4,5
6 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator –
Kalydeco Prior Authorization Policy
Rarely, patients with a sweat chloride < 30 mmol/L may be considered to have CF if
alternatives are excluded and other confirmatory tests (genetic and physiologic
testing) support a CF diagnosis. In patients with a sweat chloride test of ≥ 30 to <
60 mmol/L, CFTR genetic analysis is undertaken. If the genetic analysis identifies two
CF-causing CFTR mutations, CF is diagnosed; if no CFTR mutations are identified, a
diagnosis of CF is unlikely. In patients with a CFTR genotype that is undefined or of
varying clinical consequence, full gene CFTR sequencing (if not already performed)
or CFTR physiologic testing is performed (NPD or ICM). If only one CFTR variant is
identified on limited analysis, full gene CFTR sequencing should be performed. CF is
possible if both alleles possess CF-causing, undefined, or mutation of varying clinical
consequence mutations; CF is unlikely if only no CF-causing mutations are found. If
results of the NPD or ICM show CFTR dysfunction, CF is diagnosed; when testing is
unavailable or equivocal, the diagnosis of CF is not resolved, and when results of the
physiologic testing show CFTR function is preserved, a diagnosis of CF is considered
unlikely. It is recommended that patients with challenging diagnoses be evaluated at
an accredited CF Foundation Care Center.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Kalydeco. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Kalydeco as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and efficacy, approval requires Kalydeco to
be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition
being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Kalydeco® (ivacaftor tablets and oral granules – Vertex)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Cystic Fibrosis, Patient Homozygous for the F508del Mutation in the
Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Gene. Efficacy
results from a double-blind, placebo controlled trial in patients with cystic fibrosis
who were homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane regulator gene showed no statistically significant difference in
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) over 16 weeks of Kalydeco treatment
1
compared with placebo.1 In a Phase II trial in patients homozygous for the
F508del mutation (n = 112), Kalydeco did not result in an improvement in FEV
1
relative to placebo.3
2. Cystic Fibrosis, Patient with Unknown Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane
Conductance Regulator Gene Mutation. An FDA-cleared cystic fibrosis
mutation test should be used to detect the presence of the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator mutation prior to use of Kalydeco.1
3. Combination Therapy with Other Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane
Conductance Regulator Modulator(s). Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor tablets

Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor; ivacaftor co-packaged tablets and oral
granules) contain ivacaftor, the active agent in Kalydeco and therefore use of
these agents is not indicated in combination with Kalydeco.
Note: Examples of other cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
modulators are: Alyftrek™ (vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor tablets),
Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor tablets and oral granules), Symdeko
(tezacaftor/ivacaftor; ivacaftor tablets), Trikafta®
(elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor; ivacaftor co-packaged tablets and oral
granules).
4. Infertility. Kalydeco is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in a patient
≥ 1 month of age who has one mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator gene that is responsive to Kalydeco based on clinical and/or
in vitro assay data.1
Note: A patient with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis should be reviewed using criteria
for the FDA-approved indication, above.
