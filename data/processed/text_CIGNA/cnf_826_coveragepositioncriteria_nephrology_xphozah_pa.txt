INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Xphozah, a sodium hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) inhibitor, is indicated to reduce
serum phosphorus in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis as add-on
therapy in patients who have an inadequate response to phosphate binders or who
are intolerant of any dose of phosphate binder therapy.1
Efficacy
The efficacy of Xphozah was evaluated in three pivotal trials (PHREEDOM, BLOCK,
and AMPLIFY) in patients with CKD on dialysis with hyperphosphatemia. In the
PHREEDOM and BLOCK trials, patients had a serum phosphorus level of at least 6.0
mg/dL to 10.0 mg/dL.1 In the AMPLIFY trial, patients had a serum phosphate level
of 5.5 to 10 mg/dL. All patients had been on maintenance dialysis for ≥ 3 months.
In all three pivotal trials, the primary endpoint, which was the difference in the mean
change in serum phosphate levels, in patients taking Xphozah vs. placebo was
statistically significant.

Guidelines
The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published a 2017 clinical
practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of
CKD-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD), which is a selective update of the prior
CKD-MBD guideline published in 2009.2 Xphozah is not mentioned in the guidelines.
The classification of CKD in these guidelines is based upon glomerular filtration rate
(G1 to G5) and albuminemia (A1 to A3); G5D represents kidney failure on dialysis.
Treatment options for hyperphosphatemia include diet modification, phosphate-
lowering therapy, and intensified dialysis for patients with CKD stage G5D. The
following are recommendations in patients with CKD G3a to G5D. Elevated
phosphate levels are suggested to be lowered toward the normal range (Grade 2C
recommendation). The guideline update does not provide the reference value of
normal range. Decisions about phosphate-lowering treatment are suggested to be
based on progressively or persistently elevated serum phosphate (not graded). The
broader term “phosphate-lowering” treatment is used instead of phosphate-binding
agents since all possible approaches (i.e., phosphate binders, diet, dialysis) can be
effective, which is a change from the 2009 guidelines.3
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Xphozah. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Xphozah as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Xphozah to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
