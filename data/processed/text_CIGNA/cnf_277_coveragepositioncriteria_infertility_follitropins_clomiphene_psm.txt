INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
The Gonal-f products and Follistim AQ are gonadotropins (follicle stimulating
hormones [FSH]).1-5 The Gonal-f products and Follistim AQ are indicated for the
induction of ovulation and pregnancy in the anovulatory infertile patient, in
whom the cause of infertility is functional and not due to primary ovarian failure.
The Gonal-f products are also indicated for the development of multiple follicles in
ovulatory patients participating in an assisted reproductive technology (ART)
program.1-3 Follistim AQ is also indicated in normal ovulatory women undergoing
controlled ovarian stimulation as part of an in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic
sperm injection cycle.4 Gonal-f (but not Gonal-f RFF) and Follistim AQ are also
indicated for the induction of spermatogenesis in men with primary and secondary
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in whom the cause of infertility is not due to
primary testicular failure.1-4

Management Policy
Clomiphene citrate tablets are indicated for the treatment of ovulatory
dysfunction in women who desire pregnancy.5 Patients most likely to achieve
success with clomiphene therapy include patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome
(PCOS), amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome, psychogenic amenorrhea, post-oral
contraceptive amenorrhea, and certain cases of secondary amenorrhea of
undetermined etiology.
Guidelines
American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) committee opinion (2020) on
the use of exogenous gonadotropins for ovulation induction in anovulatory women
note that gonadotropin therapy has more risks than oral ovulation induction.7 The
publication states that gonadotropin therapy should only be used by clinicians who
have the training and experience to use these products. Most women will respond
to ovulation induction with oral medications, but exogenous gonadotropin treatment
may be an option in women who fail to respond to lifestyle modifications and oral
agents. The ASRM opinion states that there is no significant advantage to using
any specific gonadotropin preparation.
An international evidence-based guideline for the management of PCOS was
released in 2023.6 The guideline recommends that letrozole should be the first-line
pharmacological treatment in women with PCOS and anovulatory infertility without
other infertility factors. Both metformin and clomiphene could be used in women
with PCOS with anovulatory infertility and no other infertility factors.
Gonadotropins (e.g., FSH) alone could be considered rather than clomiphene citrate
therapy. Gonadotropins could also be second-line pharmacological therapy for
women with PCOS who have failed first-line oral ovulation induction therapy and
are anovulatory and infertile with no other infertility factors. Gonadotropins could
also be considered rather than the combination of clomiphene citrate and
metformin in patients who are clomiphene-resistant. These guidelines additionally
state there appears to be no difference in the clinical efficacy of gonadotropins
preparations.
POLICY STATEMENT
This Preferred Specialty Management program has been developed to encourage
the use of the Preferred Products. Utilization of the follitropin products and
clomiphene is not managed by Prior Authorization criteria, but is based on whether
the patient’s benefit includes infertility coverage. The program directs the patient
to try the Preferred Products prior to the approval of a Non-Preferred Product.
Requests for Non-Preferred Products (Step 3) will also be reviewed using the
exception criteria (below). All approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
Preferred Products
Step 1: Clomid, Clomiphene citrate
Step 2: Gonal-f, Gonal-f RFF, Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject
Non-Preferred Products
Step 3: Follistim AQ
