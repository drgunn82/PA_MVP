INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES

DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
All forms of clobazam are indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients ≥ 2 years of age.1,2
Disease Overview
LGS, a severe epileptic and developmental encephalopathy, is associated with a high rate of
morbidity and mortality.3,4 LGS most often begins between 3 and 5 years of age and
comprises approximately 4% to 10% of childhood epilepsies; the prevalence is 0.26 per
1,000 people.3-6 Affected children experience several different types of seizures, most
commonly atonic seizures (sudden loss of muscle tone and limpness, also called drop
seizures) and tonic seizures (increased muscle tone and muscle stiffness).3,6 Seizures
associated with LGS are usually resistant to treatment.6 The three main forms of treatment
of LGS are antiseizure medications (ASMs), dietary therapy (typically the ketogenic diet),
and device/surgery (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation, corpus callosotomy).6 None of the
therapies are effective in all cases of LGS and the disorder has proven particularly resistant
to most therapeutic options. The choice of treatment should take into consideration the
patient’s age and other associated conditions.

Dravet syndrome is a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy (dysfunction of the brain)
marked with frequent and/or prolonged seizures.7,8 It has been estimated that 1 out of
20,000 to 40,000 infants born in the US are affected with Dravet syndrome. The seizures
generally begin in the first year of life in an otherwise healthy infant. Affected individuals
can develop many seizure types: myoclonic, tonic-clonic, absence, atypical absence, atonic,
focal aware or impaired awareness (previously called partial seizures), and status
epilepticus.8 As the seizures continue, most of the children develop some level of
developmental disability and other conditions associated with the syndrome. Two or more
ASMs are often needed to control the seizures; most of the seizures are refractory to
medications. The goals of treatment are cessation of prolonged convulsions, reductions in
overall seizure frequency, and minimization of treatment side effects.9,10 Some patients
respond to the ketogenic diet and/or vagus nerve stimulation.
Guidelines/Recommendations
The American Academy of Neurology and the American Epilepsy Society published a
guideline update for treatment-resistant epilepsy (2018) stating that clobazam is probably
effective as add-on therapy for LGS and is possibly effective as add-on therapy for
treatment-resistant adult focal epilepsy.13 Adjunctive therapy with clobazam has been
effective in the treatment of uncontrolled or refractory epilepsy in adults and children.14 If
first-line treatment is ineffective or not tolerated, clobazam has been used as adjunctive
treatment of refractory focal seizures (partial seizure and localization-related seizure) in
children, young adults, and adults; adjunctive treatment of generalized tonic-clonic seizures
in children, young adults, and adults; and adjunctive treatment of children and young adults
with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, Panayiotopoulos syndrome or late-onset
childhood occipital epilepsy (Gastaut type).
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
Currently, the FDA-approved drugs for this condition are Epidiolex® (cannabidiol oral
solution), felbamate, lamotrigine, rufinamide tablets and oral suspension, topiramate,
clobazam, and Fintepla® (fenfluramine oral solution).11,14 Despite the lack of level I or level
II evidence, valproic acid remains a mainstay in treatment.5,6,12 If valproic acid does not
provide adequate seizure control, which is almost always the case, lamotrigine should be
added as the first adjunctive therapy.4 If the combination regimen of valproic acid and
lamotrigine does not provide adequate control, then rufinamide should be initiated and
either valproic acid or lamotrigine should be discontinued. If seizure control is still not
achieved, the next adjunctive therapies to consider are topiramate, clobazam, and
felbamate. There is limited evidence for the use of levetiracetam, zonisamide, and
Fycompa® (perampanel tablet, oral suspension). Where possible, no more than two ASMs
should be used concomitantly; use of multiple ASMs raises the risk of adverse effects and/or
drug-drug interactions.
Dravet Syndrome
Valproic acid and clobazam are considered to be the first-line treatment for Dravet
syndrome.7,9,10 If seizure control is suboptimal, Diacomit® (stiripentol capsules), Epidiolex,
Fintepla, and topiramate are treatment options. If control is still inadequate, other therapies
to consider are clonazepam, levetiracetam, and zonisamide. Drugs that should be avoided in
Dravet syndrome include sodium channel blockers (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine,
lamotrigine, and phenytoin), Sabril® (vigabatrin tablet, oral packet), and tiagabine.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of clobazam. Because
of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
