INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ruconest, a recombinant C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), is indicated for the
treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in adults and
adolescent patients.1
Dosing
The recommended dose of Ruconest is 50 units/kg, up to a maximum dose of 4,200
units administered as a slow intravenous injection over approximately five
minutes.1 If the attack symptoms persist, an additional dose can be administered
at the recommended dose level. Do not exceed 4,200 units per dose. No more
than two doses should be administered within a 24-hour period. Of note, in the
clinical trial, rescue treatment with Ruconest was administered if a patient did not
experience the beginning of relief within 4 hours after the first dose. The second
rescue dose was only required for 11% of Ruconest-treated patients; most patients
responded to a single dose.
Availability

Management Policy – Per Days
Ruconest is supplied in single-use 25 mL glass vials containing 2,100 units of
Ruconest as lyophilized powder for reconstitution.1 Each carton contains one
single-use vial.
Guidelines
US HAE Medical Advisory Board guidelines (2020) recommend that all patients with
laboratory confirmed HAE should have access to at least two standard doses of an
approved on-demand medication for treatment of acute attacks.2 On-demand
treatment of attacks is most effective when administered early after attack onset.
Additional Information
In the pivotal studies of Ruconest in patients with peripheral, abdominal, or
oropharyngeal-laryngeal HAE attacks, at baseline (prior to Ruconest therapy), the
mean number of attacks per year was 28 (range: 0 to 143) in Study 1 and 17 in
Study 2.3,4 The majority of patients were on prophylactic therapy. Additionally, in
the open-label extension phase of Study 1, 97% of attacks were able to be
successfully treated with only one dose of Ruconest 50 U/kg (up to a maximum of
4,200 units).1 In a pooled post-hoc analysis of the pivotal trials, the vast majority
of attacks (90.7%) responded to Ruconest treatment within 4 hours and only 7.1%
of attacks treated with Ruconest reoccurred within 72 hours of initial treatment.
Based on the above data, the average patient is estimated to experience 2 to 3
attacks per month, but additional attacks may occur. The quantity limits outlined
below provide for the patient to treat 4 attacks (at the maximum Ruconest dose)
per 28 days, with an override provided to treat an additional 4 attacks (at the
maximum Ruconest dose) each month.
POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to promote the safe,
effective, and economic use of Ruconest. If the Drug Quantity Management rule is
not met for the requested medication at the point of service, coverage will be
determined by the Criteria below. “One-time” approvals are provided for 30 days in
duration.

CRITERIA
1. If the patient requires additional doses of Ruconest to treat a subsequent attack
of hereditary angioedema (HAE), approve a one-time override for 16 additional
vials at retail or home delivery.
Note: At retail, the approval quantity should be the number of Ruconest vials
the patient has received in the past 28 days plus 16 vials. At home delivery, the
