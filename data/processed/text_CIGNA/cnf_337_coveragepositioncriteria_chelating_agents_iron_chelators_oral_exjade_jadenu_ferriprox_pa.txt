CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Exjade, Jadenu (granules and tablets), and Ferriprox (granules and oral solution)
are orally administered iron chelators used for the treatment of iron overload.1-4
Exjade and Jadenu have the same chemical entity (deferasirox) in different
formulations.1,2 Note: deferoxamine is an intravenously administered iron chelator
that is not targeted in this Policy.
Deferasirox (Exjade, Jadenu/Sprinkle; generics) is indicated for the following
uses:1,2
• Chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions (transfusional
hemosiderosis), in patients ≥ 2 years of age.
• Chronic iron overload in non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia
syndromes, in patients ≥ 10 years of age with a liver iron concentration of
at least 5 mg of iron per gram of liver dry weight and a serum ferritin level >
300 mcg/L.

Authorization Policy
Limitations of Use: The safety and efficacy of deferasirox when administered
with other iron chelation therapy have not been established.1,2
Deferiprone tablets (Ferriprox tablets, generic) are indicated for the following uses:3
• Transfusional iron overload with thalassemia syndromes, in patients ≥
8 years of age.
• Transfusional iron overload with sickle cell disease or other anemias,
in patients ≥ 8 years of age.
Ferriprox (deferiprone) oral solution is indicated for the following uses:4
• Transfusional iron overload with thalassemia syndromes, in patients ≥
3 years of age.
• Transfusional iron overload with sickle cell disease or other anemias,
in patients ≥ 3 years of age.
Limitations of Use: Safety and effectiveness of deferiprone have not been
established for the treatment of transfusional iron overload in patients with
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or in patients with Diamond Blackfan
anemia.3,4

Disease Overview
Iron chelating therapy should be considered in all patients who require long-term
blood transfusions.5 Patients with sickle cell disease, myelodysplastic syndromes
(MDS), thalassemia major, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, aplastic anemia, and other
congenital and acquired forms of refractory anemia (e.g., hereditary
hemochromatosis) may require regular blood transfusions and as a result, may
require iron chelating therapy. This is because the body does not have an efficient
mechanism to excrete iron. In patients requiring multiple blood transfusions, iron
accumulates and is deposited into multiple organ systems. The long-term
consequences of chronic iron overload include multiple organ dysfunction (e.g.,
heart, liver) and/or organ failure. Iron chelation therapy is necessary to prevent
organ failure and decrease mortality.
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
Iron overload in thalassemia intermedia is mainly due to increased intestinal
absorption of iron due to chronic anemia.10 Transfusions play a minor role in iron
overloading in these patients, but iron chelation therapy is indicated for thalassemia
intermedia. A 5-year randomized, open-label, long-term trial was conducted in
patients (n = 88) with thalassemia intermedia comparing Ferriprox with
7 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Chelating Agents – Iron Chelators (Oral) Prior Authorization
Policy
deferoxamine intravenous (IV) treatment. After 5 years, there were no statistically
significant differences between Ferriprox and deferoxamine in the decrease in mean
serum ferritin levels and overall survival. There are data available from other
studies as well with Ferriprox use in iron-loaded non-transfusion dependent
thalassemias.11
GUIDELINES
• Thalassemia Syndromes:
o The Thalassemia International Federation published guidelines (2021)
for transfusion-dependent thalassemia.7 Initiation of an iron chelator
generally starts after 10 to 20 red blood cell (RBC) infusions or when
serum ferritin level is > 1,000 mcg/L. Recommendations advise use
based on patient characteristics and FDA-approved indications, and
also advocate for switching, rotating, and combining chelator regimens
as needed to control iron balance or distribution.
o The Thalassemia International Federation guidelines for the
management of non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (2023)
recommend iron chelation therapy with deferasirox in patients ≥ 10
years of age with liver iron concentration ≥ 5 mg of iron per gram of
liver dry weight, serum ferritin level ≥ 800 ng/mL, and other
scenarios.6
o The American Heart Association (AHA) published a consensus
statement (2013) on cardiovascular function and treatment in patients
with β-thalassemia major.8 Deferasirox, deferiprone, and
deferoxamine (injectable iron chelator) are recommended chelating
treatments. The AHA advises the use of Ferriprox monotherapy in
patients with cardiac siderosis, patients with reduced left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF), or asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.
Exjade and Jadenu monotherapy can be used in patients with
detectable cardiac iron levels and normal cardiac function. However,
Exjade and Jadenu are not recommended as first-choice treatment for
cardiac siderosis with cardiac iron (T2*) < 6 ms or in patients with
reduced LVEF.
• MDS: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for
MDS (version 2.2025 – January 17, 2025) have recommendations for the
management of iron overload.9 NCCN advises consideration of deferasirox
orally or deferoxamine (injectable iron chelator) for iron chelation to
decrease iron overload (aiming for target ferritin level < 1,000 mcg/mL) in
patients who have received >20 to 30 RBC transfusions, particularly for
patients with lower-risk MDS or who are potential transplant candidates (with
low to intermediate-1 MDS). The guidelines note that deferiprone is
available; however, controversy remains regarding the use of this agent for
MDS due to the Boxed Warning for agranulocytosis.
POLICY STATEMENT
7 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Chelating Agents – Iron Chelators (Oral) Prior Authorization
Policy
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of oral iron
chelators. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with oral
iron chelators as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, initial approval requires oral iron chelators to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
Documentation: Documentation is required for use of oral iron chelators as noted
in the criteria as [documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is
not limited to, chart notes, prescription claims records, prescription receipts, and/or
other information.
