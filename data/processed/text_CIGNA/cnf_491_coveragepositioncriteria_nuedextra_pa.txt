CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Nuedexta, a combination product containing dextromethorphan hydrobromide (DM)
and quinidine sulfate, is indicated for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect.1
The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically, as spontaneous
improvement of pseudobulbar affect occurs in some patients.1
Disease Overview
Pseudobulbar affect is a neurologic condition characterized by involuntary outbursts
of laughing and/or crying incongruous or disproportionate to the patients’ emotional
state.2,7 There are many terms that have been used to describe this condition,
including pathological laughing and crying, affective lability, emotional incontinence,
emotionalism, and involuntary emotional expression disorder.7 Pseudobulbar affect,
hypothesized to arise from disconnection of brainstem structures from cortical
inhibition, is associated with underlying central nervous system disorders including
stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS).2 In addition to the effects of the underlying
disorder, pseudobulbar affect can have a severe impact on well-being and social
functioning and can be highly disabling, owing in part to the stigma attached to loss
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Nuedexta Prior Authorization Policy
of emotional control. Episodes of laughing can also lead to respiratory compromise,
especially in patients with a neurological disorder that already compromises
respiratory function, such as ALS.7 For these reasons, treatment should be strongly
considered in any patient with pseudobulbar affect. The goal of therapy is to reduce
the frequency of attacks.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Nuedexta was established in one trial in patients with pseudobulbar
affect with underlying ALS or MS.1,2 Two additional trials conducted with higher doses
(DM 30 mg/quinidine 30 mg) provided supportive evidence.3,4 PRISM II, an open-
label, 90-day, published study, evaluated Nuedexta in patients with pseudobulbar
affect and a diagnosis of dementia, stroke, or traumatic brain injury (n = 367).8
Nuedexta was shown to be an effective treatment for pseudobulbar affect secondary
to dementia, stroke, or traumatic brain injury, showing similar improvement to that
reported in patients with pseudobulbar affect secondary to ALS or MS.
Guidelines
There are no guidelines specific to the management of pseudobulbar affect. However,
the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) published an evidence-based guideline
on the assessment and management of psychiatric disorders in individuals with MS
(reaffirmed 2019).5 The guideline found that Nuedexta is possibly effective and may
be considered for treating individuals with MS with pseudobulbar affect (Level C, one
Class II study). Also, prior to the approval of Nuedexta, the AAN published a practice
parameter on the care of the patient with ALS (reaffirmed 2023).6 With regard to
pharmacologic measures to reduce pseudobulbar affect, the AAN concludes that the
combination DM/quinidine product is probably effective for pseudobulbar affect in
ALS based on one Class I study3, although side effects may limit its usefulness.
Therefore, the AAN recommends that if approved by the FDA, and if side effects are
acceptable, the combination DM/quinidine product should be considered for
symptoms of pseudobulbar affect in patients with ALS (Level B). No other
pharmacologic agents are addressed in the practice parameter for use in the
management of pseudobulbar affect.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Nuedexta.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with Nuedexta as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and
long-term efficacy, approval requires Nuedexta to be prescribed by or in consultation
with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated. All approvals are
provided for the duration noted below.
• Nuedexta® (dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate
capsules – Avanir)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Nuedexta Prior Authorization Policy
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Treatment of Pseudobulbar Affect. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
BOTH of the following (A and B):
A) Patient has pseudobulbar affect associated with a chronic neurological
condition; AND
Note: Examples of chronic neurological conditions include amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, stroke, dementia, traumatic brain injury.
B) Nuedexta is prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Nuedexta® (dextromethorphan hydrobromide and quinidine sulfate
capsules – Avanir)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Heroin Detoxification. Limited published data are available in patients
undergoing heroin detoxification.9 The available study was conducted with the
DM 30 mg/quinidine 30 mg formulation, using daily doses of DM 60 mg/quinidine
60 mg (dose cannot be achieved with Nuedexta capsules). There were no
differences between DM/quinidine and placebo with regard to reducing opioid
withdrawal symptoms.
2. Levodopa-Induced Dyskinesia in Parkinson’s Disease. A single pilot study
demonstrated benefit with dextromethorphan/quinidine for treating levodopa-
induced dyskinesia in Parkinson’s disease.12 Larger studies with a longer
treatment duration are needed to define the place in therapy for Nuedexta in this
condition.
3. Neuropathic Pain. Limited published data are available in patients (n = 36) with
diabetic peripheral neuropathic (DPN) pain (open-label tolerability study).10 The
available study was conducted with the DM 30 mg/quinidine 30 mg formulation,
using daily doses up to DM 120 mg/quinidine 120 mg (dose cannot be achieved
with Nuedexta capsules). Higher daily doses of DM and quinidine (60 mg/60 mg
and 90 mg/60 mg [doses cannot be achieved with Nuedexta capsules]) have also
been evaluated in patients with DPN pain (n = 379) in one Phase III, randomized,
placebo-controlled 13-week study.7 Both DM/quinidine treatment groups had
significant reductions in mean daily pain scores vs. placebo. More data are needed
to define the place in therapy of Nuedexta in the treatment of neuropathic pain.
4. Psychosis-Related Aggression. A case series (n = 4) supports DM/quinidine
as a potential alternative to conventional regimens for treating aggression and
impulsive behavior in patients with psychotic disorder.11 More data are needed
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Nuedexta Prior Authorization Policy
to define the place in therapy of Nuedexta in the treatment of psychosis-related
aggression.
5. Treatment-Resistant Depression. A Phase II, open-label, proof-of-concept
study (n = 20) demonstrated preliminary efficacy for DM 45 mg/quinidine 10 mg
every 12 hours. This dosing could not be achieved with Nuedexta capsules.13
Additional data are needed to define the place in therapy for Nuedexta in the
treatment of treatment-resistant depression.
