CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Nurtec ODT, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, is
indicated in adults for the following uses:1
• Acute treatment of migraine with or without aura.
• Preventive treatment of episodic migraine.
Disease Overview
Migraine is a common, ongoing condition marked by paroxysmal, unilateral attacks
of moderate to severe throbbing headache which is aggravated by routine physical
activity (e.g., walking or climbing stairs) and associated with nausea, vomiting,
and/or photophobia and phonophobia.2 Migraines have been defined as chronic or
episodic. Chronic migraine is described by the International Headache Society as
headache occurring on ≥ 15 days/month for more than 3 months, which has the
features of migraine headache on ≥ 8 days/month. Episodic migraine is characterized
by headaches that occur < 15 days/month.
Guidelines
Triptans (e.g., almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan,
sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan) are considered the gold standard for acute treatment
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Migraine – Nurtec ODT Prior Authorization Policy
of moderate to severe migraine headaches or mild to moderate migraine headaches
that respond poorly to over-the-counter analgesics.2 An assessment of the
preventive and acute treatment of migraine by the American Headache Society (AHS)
[2018; updated 2021] reaffirms previous migraine guidelines.3,4 Nurtec ODT is not
addressed for its preventive treatment of episodic migraine indication in the
guideline. The update lists the triptans, dihydroergotamine, the oral gepants (Nurtec
ODT and Ubrelvy® [ubrogepant tablets]), and Reyvow® (lasmiditan tablets) as
effective treatments for moderate or severe acute migraine attacks and mild to
moderate attacks that respond poorly to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, non-
opioid analgesics, acetaminophen, or caffeinated combinations (e.g., aspirin +
acetaminophen + caffeine).
In the updated assessment by the AHS on the preventive and acute treatment of
migraine, it states that patients with migraine should be considered for preventive
treatment in the following situations: when attacks significantly interfere with
patients’ daily routines despite acute treatment; frequent attacks (≥ 4 monthly
headache days); at least moderate disability (Migraine Disability Assessment
[MIDAS] score ≥ 11 or six-item Headache Impact Test [HIT-6] score > 50);
contraindication to, failure, overuse, or adverse events with acute treatments; or
patient preference.3,4 Before developing a preventive treatment plan, the appropriate
use (e.g., drug type, route and timing of administration, frequency) of acute
treatments should be initiated and coupled with education and lifestyle modifications.
All patients with migraine should be offered a trial of acute treatment. Based on the
level of evidence for efficacy and the American Academy of Neurology scheme for
classification of evidence, the following oral treatments have established efficacy and
should be offered for migraine prevention: antiepileptic drugs (divalproex sodium,
valproate sodium, topiramate [not for females of childbearing potential without a
reliable method of birth control]); beta-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol,
timolol); and frovatriptan (for short-term preventive treatment of menstrual
migraine). The following treatments are probably effective and should be considered
for migraine prevention: antidepressants (amitriptyline, venlafaxine); beta-
blockers (atenolol, nadolol); and angiotensin receptor blockers (candesartan).
The AHS issued an update to their position statement (2024) specifically regarding
therapies targeting CGRP for the prevention of migraine.5 The evidence for the
efficacy, tolerability, and safety of CGRP-targeting migraine preventive therapies
(specifically, the monoclonal antibodies: Aimovig [erenumab-aooe subcutaneous
{SC} injection], Ajovy® [fremanezumab-vfrm SC injection], Emgality®
[galcanezumab-gnlm SC injection], and Vyepti® [eptinezumab-jjmr intravenous
infusion] and the gepants: Nurtec® ODT and Qulipta® [atogepant tablets]) is
substantial and consistent across different individual CGRP-targeting treatments.
Extensive “real-world” clinical experience corroborates clinical trials. This data
indicates that the efficacy and tolerability of CGRP-targeting therapies are equal to
or greater than those of previous first-line therapies. The CGRP-targeting therapies
should be considered as a first-line approach for migraine prevention along with
previous first-line treatments without a requirement for prior failure of other classes
of migraine preventive treatment. Additionally, Botox® (onabotulinumtoxinA SC
injection) is considered a first-line therapy for prevention of chronic migraine.

POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Nurtec ODT.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
• Nurtec® ODT (rimegepant sulfate orally disintegrating tablets – Pfizer)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Migraine, Acute Treatment. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets BOTH of
the following (A and B):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) Patient meets ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Patient has tried at least one triptan therapy; OR
ii. According to the prescriber, patient has a contraindication to triptan(s).
Note: Examples of contraindications to triptans include a history of
coronary artery disease; cardiac accessory conduction pathway disorders;
history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or hemiplegic or basilar
migraine; peripheral vascular disease; ischemic bowel disease;
uncontrolled hypertension; or severe hepatic impairment.
2. Preventive Treatment of Episodic Migraine. Approve for 1 year if the patient
meets ALL of the following (A, B, and C):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) Patient has ≥ 4 and < 15 migraine headache days per month (prior to initiating
a migraine-preventive medication); AND
C) If the patient is currently taking Nurtec ODT, patient has had a significant
clinical benefit from the medication as determined by the prescriber.
Note: Examples of significant clinical benefit include a reduction in the overall
number of migraine days per month or a reduction in number of severe
migraine days per month from the time that Nurtec ODT was initiated.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Nurtec® ODT (rimegepant sulfate orally disintegrating tablets – Pfizer)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with Another Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP)
Inhibitor Being Prescribed for Migraine Headache Prevention if Nurtec
ODT is Being Taken for the Preventive Treatment of Episodic Migraine.
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Migraine – Nurtec ODT Prior Authorization Policy
Note: Examples of CGRP inhibitors that are indicated for migraine headache
prevention include Aimovig (erenumab-aooe subcutaneous injection), Ajovy
(fremanezumab-vfrm subcutaneous injection), Emgality (galcanezumab-gnlm
subcutaneous injection), Vyepti (eptinezumab-jjmr intravenous infusion), Nurtec
ODT (rimegepant sulfate orally disintegrating tablets), and Qulipta (atogepant
tablets). Aimovig, Ajovy, Emgality, and Vyepti are injectable CGRP inhibitors for
migraine prevention and have not been studied for use in combination with
another agent in the same class.6-9 Qulipta is an oral CGRP inhibitor for the
preventive treatment of migraine in adults.10 The clinical trial of Nurtec ODT for
the preventive treatment of episodic migraine did not allow the use of a
concomitant medication that acts on the CGRP pathway.1
