CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Empaveli, a complement C3 inhibitor, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G), to reduce proteinuria in adults and
pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age.
• Immune-complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-
MPGN) [primary], to reduce proteinuria in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 12
years of age.
• Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), treatment in adults.
Empaveli is given subcutaneously, via an infusion pump or an on-body injector.1
Empaveli is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional; after
proper training, Empaveli may be self-administered or be administered by a
caregiver.

Policy
Empaveli has a Boxed Warning regarding serious infections caused by encapsulated
bacteria.1 Empaveli is only available through a restricted access program, Empaveli
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).
Disease Overview
C3G and IC-MPG
C3G and IC-MPGN (also known as immunoglobulin-mediated membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis [MPGN]) are in a group of kidney disorders termed MPGN.2-5
C3G and IC-MPGN are rare and chronic complement-mediated kidney diseases.2-4
MPGN occurs due to glomerular deposition of immune complexes and/or
complement factors.2 IC-MPGN is classified as “idiopathic” or “primary” when an
underlying cause is not identified and “secondary” when the condition is due to an
underlying disease (e.g., infection or autoimmune condition).2,5 The incidence of
idiopathic IC-MPGN is unknown; the estimated global annual incidence of C3G is
between 1 and 3 cases per one million people.2 Patients with either condition are at
risk of kidney failure; risk of progression to kidney failure is up to 30% to 35% of
patients with C3G and idiopathic IC-MPGN within 10 years of diagnosis. There are
overlapping pathologic features of C3G and IC-MPGN; dysregulation of the
complement pathway plays a key role in the pathogenesis of both diseases. In C3G,
overactivation of the alternative complement pathway leads to accumulation of C3
in the glomerulus, resulting in kidney inflammation and damage. The role of the
complement system in the pathogenesis of IC-MPGN is less well-understood; both
the classical and alternative complement pathway are activated but the
mechanisms by which immune complexes are deposited are unknown. Patients with
C3G and IC-MPGN may exhibit similar clinical signs and symptoms at disease onset,
including proteinuria, hematuria, decreased kidney function, nephrotic syndrome,
and hypertension. Although biopsy is needed for a definitive diagnosis,
distinguishing between the two diseases remain a challenge due to overlap in the
composition of the glomerular deposits. In addition, it is unclear whether idiopathic
IC-MPGN and C3G are distinct entities or two aspects of the same disease as the
two conditions share similar clinical presentations and patient outcomes, including
similar risk of progression to kidney disease and prevalence of nephrotic syndrome.
Current treatment options, which primarily target inflammation and slow down the
progression of kidney disease, include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs,
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs), and complement inhibitors.2-5 It is unclear if immunosuppressive treatment
(e.g., calcineurin inhibitors, cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, mycophenolate
mofetil) in patients with primary IC-MPGN is beneficial; outcomes data are scant
and controversial.6 In addition, long term benefit of corticosteroids and
immunosuppressive therapies are uncertain.2
PNH
PNH is a rare, genetic disorder of hematopoietic stem cells.7,8 The mutation in the
X-linked gene phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) results in a deficiency in
the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) protein, which is responsible for anchoring
other protein moieties to the surface of the erythrocytes. Loss of anchoring of these
proteins causes cells to hemolyze and leads to complications such as hemolytic
anemia, thrombosis, and peripheral blood cytopenias. PNH is a clinical diagnosis
Page 2 of 7 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Complement Inhibitors – Empaveli Prior Authorization
Policy
that should be confirmed with peripheral blood flow cytometry to detect the
absence or severe deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins on at least two lineages.7,9
Prior to the availability of complement inhibitors, only supportive measures in terms
of managing the cytopenias and controlling thrombotic risk were available.
Supportive measures include platelet transfusion, immunosuppressive therapy for
patients with bone marrow failure, use of erythropoietin for anemias, and
aggressive anticoagulation.
Dosing Recommendations When Switching to Empaveli from eculizumab
intravenous infusion (Soliris®, biosimilars) or Ultomiris (ravulizumab-
cwvz) for Treatment of PNH
For patients switching from eculizumab intravenous [IV] infusion (Soliris,
biosimilars) to Empaveli, initiate Empaveli while continuing eculizumab at the
current dose.1 After 4 weeks, discontinue eculizumab and continue Empaveli
monotherapy. For patients switching from Ultomiris® (ravulizumab-cwvz IV
infusion), initiate Empaveli no more than 4 weeks after the last dose of Ultomiris.
Clinical Efficacy in C3G and IC-MPGN
The efficacy of Empaveli in reducing proteinuria in patients with native kidney C3G,
native kidney IC-MPGN, or recurrent C3G following kidney transplant was shown in
the VALIANT study. Enrolled patients were ≥ 12 years of age and weigh ≥ 30 kg
with biopsy-proven, native kidney or post-transplant recurrent C3G or native kidney
primary IC-MPGN. In addition, patients had estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, proteinuria ≥ 1 g/day, and urine protein-to-
creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 1 g/g. Patients were required to be on stable and
optimized doses of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and/or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2
(SGLT2) inhibitors for at least 12 weeks before randomization and throughout the
26-week placebo-controlled period. Immunosuppressants (e.g., steroids < 20
mg/day, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus) had to be stable for at least 12 weeks
before randomization and throughout the placebo-controlled period. In total, 124
patients were included in the study; 88 patients (71%) had native kidney C3G, 27
patients (22%) had native kidney primary IC-MPN, and 8 patients (6%) had post-
kidney transplant recurrent C3G.
The primary efficacy endpoint was the log-transformed ratio of UPCR (sampled from
first morning urine collections) at Week 26 compared to baseline. At Week 26, the
geometric mean UPCR ratio relative to baseline was 0.33 in the Empaveli group and
1.03 in the placebo group; resulting in a 68% reduction in UPCR from baseline in
the Empaveli group compared to placebo (P < 0.0001). The treatment effect was
consistent across all subgroups, including disease type, age, transplant status (C3G
patients), sex, race, baseline disease characteristics (eGFR, UPCR), and
immunosuppressant use. A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients
who achieved the composite renal endpoint, defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in UPCR
and stable eGFR (≤ 15% reduction from baseline) during the 26-week placebo-
controlled period. This endpoint was achieved by 49% of patients in the Empaveli
group vs. 3% of patients in the placebo group (odds ratio of 27, P < 0.0001). In
total, 60% of patients in the Empaveli group achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in UPCR
from baseline to Week 26 compared to 5% of patients in the placebo group; and

Policy
68% vs. 59% of patients in the Empaveli vs. placebo, respectively, who had a
stable eGFR at Week 26. Over the first 6 months of treatment, Empaveli reduced
the loss of kidney function compared with placebo. The efficacy of Empaveli in
pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age was similar to that for adults.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Empaveli.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the
approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Empaveli as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, approval requires Empaveli to be prescribed by or in consultation with a
physician who specializes in the condition being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Empaveli™ (pegcetacoplan subcutaneous injection – Apellis)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concomitant Use with Eculizumab Intravenous Infusion (Soliris,
biosimilars) for > 4 weeks. There is no evidence to support concomitant use
of Empaveli with eculizumab. However, to reduce the risk of hemolysis from
abrupt treatment discontinuation in a patient switching from eculizumab to
Empaveli, the patient should be initiated on Empaveli while continuing
eculizumab. After 4 weeks, discontinue eculizumab and continue Empaveli
monotherapy.
