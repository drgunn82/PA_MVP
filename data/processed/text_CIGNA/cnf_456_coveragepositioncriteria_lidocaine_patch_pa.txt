CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Lidocaine 5% patch and ZTlido are indicated for the relief of pain associated with
postherpetic neuralgia (PHN).1,2
Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent that is suggested to stabilize
neuronal membranes by inhibiting sodium ion channels and the ionic fluxes required
for the initiation and conduction of neuronal impulses producing a local analgesic
effect when applied transdermally.1,2 The lidocaine penetration into intact skin is
adequate to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount needed to produce
a complete sensory block. In a single-dose, crossover study in healthy volunteers,
ZTlido demonstrated equivalent exposure and peak concentration of lidocaine to
lidocaine patch 5% (Lidoderm, generics).2
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
Lidocaine 5% patches have been shown to be effective in treating low back pain in
open-label studies in patients not achieving adequate pain relief despite as needed
or stable doses of non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, gabapentin, tramadol, or opioids.3-5 The
guidelines for treatment of low back pain (2017) do not address the use of topical
Page 1 of 7 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Lidocaine Patch Products Prior Authorization Policy
lidocaine; however, various other agents are used for pain associated with low back
pain.6 In patients with acute or subacute low back pain, the guidelines recommend
NSAIDs or skeletal muscle relaxants as pharmacologic treatment options (strong
recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). In patients with chronic low back pain
who have had an inadequate response to nonpharmacologic therapy, the guidelines
recommend consideration of pharmacologic treatment with NSAIDs as first-line
therapy or tramadol or duloxetine as second-line therapy. Of note, tramadol is a
narcotic and, like other opioids, is associated with the risk for abuse. Clinicians should
only consider opioids as an option in patients who have failed the aforementioned
treatments and only if the potential benefits outweigh the risks for individual patients
and after a discussion of known risks and realistic benefits with patients (weak
recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Moderate-quality evidence showed
no difference in pain between tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) or selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors vs. placebo, and low-quality evidence showed no differences in
function for antidepressants. Moderate-quality evidence showed that duloxetine was
associated with a small improvement in pain intensity and function vs. placebo.
Lidocaine 5% patch has been shown to be effective in treating neuropathic pain of
various forms and etiologies as monotherapy and, more commonly, as adjunctive
therapy to a stable analgesic regimen.3,7-14 There is evidence to suggest that
lidocaine 5% patch, along with several other analgesics (i.e., opioids, tramadol,
TCAs), can be effective as first-line therapy in the management of neuropathic pain.12
The 2011 evidence-based guideline on treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy,
published by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), indicates the lidocaine 5%
patch may be considered for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.15
Recommendations for the pharmacological management of neuropathic pain,
published by the Mayo Foundation, indicate that lidocaine 5% patch has shown
efficacy in patients with varying types of neuropathic pain, and are considered a first-
line therapy.16
Several open-label trials have shown lidocaine 5% patches to be effective in treating
pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee both as monotherapy and in
combination with other analgesics (e.g., NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, opioids, tramadol,
acetaminophen).17-20 In one open-label comparative trial (prematurely terminated
before enrollment goals were achieved due to safety concerns surrounding the entire
COX-2 class),21 treatment of knee osteoarthritis with lidocaine 5% patches (1-⅓
patches applied every 24 hours) resulted in comparable reductions in pain intensity
scores as celecoxib 200 mg/day.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
1. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Two open-label trials have investigated the lidocaine
5% patch for the relief of pain associated with carpal tunnel symdrome.23,24 In an
open-label, parallel-group, single-center, active-controlled trial,23 40 patients with
carpal tunnel syndrome were randomized to daily treatment with lidocaine patch
5% or an injection of lidocaine 1% plus methylprednisolone. After 4 weeks of
treatment, both groups reported statistically significant improvement in pain
scores. A 6-week, randomized, parallel-group, open-label multicenter study24
found that lidocaine 5% patches given every 24 hours and naproxen 500 mg twice
daily both led to significant reductions is the Average Pain Intensity scores in 100
patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. The 2016 American Academy of
Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) guidelines on carpal tunnel syndrome do not
mention topical lidocaine in their recommendations for treatment.25 In addition,
the AAOS guidelines have a supplemental evidence table that addresses the
studies AAOS evaluated for their guidelines. This table states that the above-
referenced articles were excluded from their guidelines because they used non-
validated outcome measures.
2. Fibromyalgia. There are no data available on the use of lidocaine patches in
treating pain associated with fibromyalgia.
3. Myofascial Pain as Adjunctive Therapy. Published data are limited to small
(n < 60 in each study) studies of lidocaine 5% patches.26-29 Larger, controlled
studies are needed to fully determine the place in therapy of lidocaine patches for
the treatment of myofascial pain.
4. Pain Associated with Rib Fractures. Lidocaine 5% patch did not significantly
improve pain control in patients with traumatic rib fractures in one randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study.30 A retrospective chart analysis found
lidocaine patches decreased pain scores in 29 patients with rib fractures vs. 29
matched controls, with no change in narcotic use and no difference in time to
return to baseline activity.31 A small (n = 44) double-blind, placebo-controlled
study in hospitalized patients with traumatic rib fracture in Taiwan found that
lidocaine 5% patch decreased pain scores after Day 5 of therapy vs. placebo, with
no difference in oral opioid use but decreased meperidine injection use.32 Larger,
controlled studies are needed to fully determine the place in therapy of lidocaine
5% patch for the treatment of pain associated with rib fractures.
5. Radiculopathy. Published data on the use of lidocaine patches in treating pain
associated with radiculopathy is limited.11,33 Larger, controlled studies are needed
to fully determine the place in therapy of lidocaine patches for the treatment of
radiculopathy.
6. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). There are no data available on the use of lidocaine
patches in treating pain associated with RA.

pain associated with sciatica.
