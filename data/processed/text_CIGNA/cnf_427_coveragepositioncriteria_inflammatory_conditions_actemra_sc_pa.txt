ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE

CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Tocilizumab subcutaneous injection, an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitor, is
approved for the following uses:1
• Giant cell arteritis in adults.
• Interstitial lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis, to slow the
rate of decline in pulmonary function in adults.
• Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, for the treatment of active
disease in patients ≥ 2 years of age.
• Rheumatoid arthritis, for treatment of adults with moderate to severe active
disease who have had an inadequate response to one or more disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
• Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, for the treatment of active disease
in patients ≥ 2 years of age.
Page 1 of 12 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Tocilizumab Subcutaneous
Products Prior Authorization Policy
Guidelines/Clinical Efficacy
IL-6 blockers are mentioned in multiple guidelines for treatment of inflammatory
conditions. Clinical data also support use of tocilizumab in other conditions.
• Giant Cell Arteritis: Recommendations from the European League Against
Rheumatism (EULAR) [2023] state the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis may be
made without biopsy if there is a high suspicion of giant cell arteritis and a
positive imaging test.2 In the pivotal trial evaluating tocilizumab subcutaneous
for giant cell arteritis (n = 251), patients were treated with corticosteroids in
an open-label fashion (20 mg to 60 mg/day) during the screening period prior
to treatment with tocilizumab subcutaneous.3,4 Sustained remission at Week
52 was achieved in 56% of patients who received tocilizumab subcutaneous
every week + 26-week prednisone taper and 53% of patients who received
tocilizumab every other week + 26-week prednisone taper vs. 14% of patients
in the 26-week prednisone taper and 18% of patients in the 52-week
prednisone taper.
• Interstitial Lung Disease Associated with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc-
ILD): EULAR guidelines for systemic sclerosis (2023) address tocilizumab.5
Regarding patients with lung involvement, tocilizumab may be considered for
treatment of SSc-ILD (level of evidence: 1b; strength of recommendation:
A). In the pivotal trial evaluating tocilizumab subcutaneous for systemic
sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease, patients were required to have a
percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC% predicted) > 55%.6
Among patients with interstitial lung disease confirmed on high-resolution
computed tomography scan (n = 136), the change from baseline in FVC%
predicted at Week 48 was significantly improved in the group taking
tocilizumab (0.07 vs. -6.40 with placebo).
• Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: The American College of
Rheumatology (ACR)/Arthritis Foundation guidelines for the treatment of
Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (2019) are specific to juvenile non-systemic
polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.7 For patients without risk factors,
initial therapy with a DMARD is conditionally recommended over a biologic
(including tocilizumab). Biologics (e.g., tocilizumab) are conditionally
recommended as initial treatment when combined with a DMARD over biologic
monotherapy.
• Polymyalgia Rheumatica: Guidelines from the European League Against
Rheumatism (EULAR)/ACR (2015) were published prior to approval of
tocilizumab for this condition.8 The minimum effective individualized duration
of glucocorticoid therapy is strongly recommended
• Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from the ACR for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis (2021) have tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and
non-TNF biologics (such as tocilizumab) equally positioned as a recommended
therapy following a trial of a conventional synthetic DMARD (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine).9
• Still’s Disease (Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis [sJIA] and Adult
Onset Still’s Disease [AOSD]): The European Alliance of Associations for
Rheumatology (EULAR) and Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PReS)
joint clinical guidelines for management of Still’s disease (2024) recognize sJIA
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Tocilizumab Subcutaneous
Products Prior Authorization Policy
and AOSD as the same disease, differing only in age of onset. Therefore, they
can collectively be referred to as Still’s disease.10 Guidelines recommend an
IL-1 or an IL-6 inhibitor be initiated as early as possible when the diagnosis is
established.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of tocilizumab
subcutaneous. All approvals are provided for the approval duration noted below. In
cases where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of a patient
treated with tocilizumab subcutaneous as well as the monitoring required for adverse
events and long-term efficacy, initial approval requires tocilizumab subcutaneous to
be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition
being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Actemra (tocilizumab subcutaneous injection - Genentech/Roche)
• Tyenne® (tocilizumab-aazg subcutaneous injection – Fresenius Kabi)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including the
following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as new published
data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination
with this medication.
2. Crohn’s Disease. In a 12-week pilot study conducted in Japan, 36 adults with
active Crohn’s disease (Crohn’s Disease Activity Index [CDAI] ≥ 150 and
increased C-reactive protein [CRP]) were randomized in a double-blind fashion to
intravenous tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks, or alternating infusions of
tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks and placebo (i.e., alternating with placebo
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Tocilizumab Subcutaneous
Products Prior Authorization Policy
every 2 weeks), or to placebo every 2 weeks.11 At baseline, the mean CDAI
ranged from 287 to 306. Patients had been treated with corticosteroids,
mesalamine-type drugs, metronidazole, or elemental diet. Six patients in the
placebo group, four on tocilizumab every 4 weeks, and one on tocilizumab every
2 weeks dropped out. The mean reduction in the CDAI score in the tocilizumab 8
mg/kg every 2 week group was 88 points – from (mean) 306 to 218. Further
studies are needed.

Selected Giant Cell Arteritis: The requirement that the patient has tried one 06/11/2025
Revision systemic corticosteroid was changed to now specify the patient has
tried or currently is taking a systemic corticosteroid, unless a systemic
corticosteroid is contraindicated.
Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: The following Note was
added “Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and adult-onset
Still’s disease (AOSD) are considered the same disease (Still’s disease)
but differ in age of onset. For a patient ≥ 18 years of age, refer to

one other systemic therapy was removed.
Still’s Disease, Adult-Onset: The new condition of approval was
added under other uses with supportive evidence.
