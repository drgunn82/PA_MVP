INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Iqirvo, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist, is indicated for
the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as
monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.1
Iqirvo was approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in alkaline
phosphatase (ALP). An improvement in survival or liver decompensation events
has not been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent
upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Limitation of use:
Iqirvo is not recommended in patients who have or develop decompensated
cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy).
Guidelines
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines for
primary biliary cholangitis (2018) state that the diagnosis can be confirmed when
patients meet two of the following criteria: 1) there is cholestasis as evidenced by
alkaline phosphatase elevation; 2) anti-mitochondrial antibodies are present, or if
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hepatology – Iqirvo Prior Authorization Policy
negative for anti-mitochondrial antibodies, other primary biliary cholangitis-specific
autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210, are present; 3) there is histologic
evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular
bile ducts. It is specifically noted that diagnosis in a patient who is negative for
anti-mitochondrial antibodies does not require a liver biopsy if other diagnostic
criteria are met.2 Treatment with UDCA (available in the US as ursodiol) is the
recommended treatment for patients with primary biliary cholangitis who have
abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. Following 12 months
of UDCA therapy, the patient should be evaluated to determine if second-line
therapy is appropriate. It is estimated that up to 40% of patients have an
inadequate response to UDCA; Ocaliva® (obeticholic acid tablets), a faresoid X
receptor agonist, should be considered for these patients. An update to the 2018
AASLD guidelines for primary biliary cholangitis (2021) provide two updated
recommendations:3 1) Fibrates can be considered as off-label alternatives for
patients with primary biliary cholangitis and inadequate response to UDCA.
However, fibrates are discouraged in patients with decompensated liver disease;
and 2) Ocaliva is contraindicated in patients with advanced cirrhosis, defined as
cirrhosis with current or prior evidence of liver decompensation (e.g.,
encephalopathy, coagulopathy) or portal hypertension (e.g., ascites,
gastroesophageal varices, or persistent thrombocytopenia). In addition, the AASLD
recommends careful monitoring of any patient with cirrhosis, even if not advanced,
receiving Ocaliva.
Safety
The safety and efficacy of Iqirvo in patients with decompensated cirrhosis have not
been established.1 Use of Iqirvo is not recommended in patients who have or
develop decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic
encephalopathy). Patients with cirrhosis should be monitored for evidence of
decompensation. Consider discontinuing Iqirvo if the patient progresses to
moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Iqirvo. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Iqirvo as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Iqirvo to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.

met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):

bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], aspartate
aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT]).
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Iqirvo™ (elafibranor tablets – Ipsen)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for ANY
other use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive;
criteria will be updated as new published data are available):
1. Alcoholic Liver Disease. There are no data available to support the use of
Iqirvo in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.
2. Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease
(MASLD)/Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), including Metabolic
Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH)/Non-Alcoholic
Steatohepatitis (NASH). In a Phase III trial (RESOLVE-IT) of Iqirvo in adults
with MASH and fibrosis, Iqirvo did not demonstrate a statistically significant
effect on the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening of
fibrosis.4 The response rate in the 717 patients enrolled was 19.2% for patients
who received Iqirvo compared to 14.7% for patients in the placebo arm.
Additionally, no significant differences as compared to placebo were achieved in
the key secondary endpoints, including fibrosis improvement of at least one
stage and changes in metabolic parameters.
