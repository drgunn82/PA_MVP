INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Xuriden, a pyrimidine analog for uridine replacement, is indicated for the treatment
of hereditary orotic aciduria in adults and pediatric patients.1
Disease Overview
Hereditary orotic aciduria, also known as orotic aciduria type 1, is an extremely rare,
autosomal recessive genetic disorder of pyrimidine metabolism.1-3 It is estimated to
affect less than 1:1,000,000 live births. Only about 20 cases have been reported in
the medical literature. In hereditary orotic aciduria, variants in the UMPS gene leads
to defective uridine 5’monophosphate synthase. Deficiency in this enzyme prevents
the last two steps in pyrimidine biosynthesis, leading to inadequate levels of uridine
monophosphate and excess levels of orotic acid (a uridine precursor). Because the
condition is so rare, hereditary orotic aciduria is not fully understood. Affected infants
may develop megaloblastic anemia, developmental delays, or failure to thrive. Orotic
acid crystals in the urine can lead to urinary obstruction. Xuriden replaces uridine in

the circulation, and as a result of feedback inhibition, overproduction of orotic acid is
reduced. Diagnosis is made by detailed patient and family history as well as thorough
clinical evaluation and examination of urine. Most individuals have their diagnosis
confirmed through molecular genetic testing; however, this is only available at
specialized laboratories.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Xuriden.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with Xuriden, approval requires the requested medication to be prescribed by
or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Xuriden® (uridine triacetate oral granules – Wellstat Therapeutics)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Hereditary Orotic Aciduria (Orotic Aciduria Type 1). Approve for 1 year if
the patient meets BOTH of the following (A and B):
A) Patient has hereditary orotic aciduria confirmed by at least ONE of the following
(i or ii):
i. Molecular genetic testing confirming biallelic pathogenic variants in the
UMPS gene; OR
ii. Clinical diagnosis supported by ALL of the following (a, b, and c):
a) At least one clinical manifestation consistent with orotic aciduria type 1;
AND
Note: Examples of clinical manifestations include megaloblastic anemia,
immunodeficiency, developmental delays, and failure to thrive.
b) First-degree family relative (i.e., parent or sibling) with hereditary orotic
aciduria; AND
c) Urinary orotic acid level above the normal reference range for the
reporting laboratory; AND
B) Xuriden is prescribed by, or in consultation with, a metabolic specialist,
geneticist, or physician specializing in the condition being treated.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Xuriden® (uridine triacetate oral granules – Wellstat Therapeutics)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s); criteria will
be updated as new published data are available.
