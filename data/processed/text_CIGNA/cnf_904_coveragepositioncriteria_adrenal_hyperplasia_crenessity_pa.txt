INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Crenessity, a corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor antagonist, is indicated
for the treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) as adjunctive
treatment to glucocorticoid replacement to control androgens in adults and pediatric
patients ≥ 4 years of age.1
Disease Overview
Classic CAH due to 21-hydroxalase deficiency is the most common cause of primary
adrenal insufficiency in children.2 The prevalence of classic CAH is 1 in 10,000 to 1
in 15,000 live births. However, the prevalence of classic CAH is lower in Black and
Asian populations. CAH typically presents during the newborn screening or by
presentation of atypical genitalia in females. Early detection can prevent salt
wasting adrenal crisis and decrease neonatal mortality. A diagnosis of CAH is most
often confirmed during the newborn screenings which tests for elevated 17-
hydroxyprogesterone levels. Other tests that are used in the diagnosis of CAH
include cosyntropin stimulation tests and genetic testing with confirmed cytochrome
(CYP)21A2 genotype. Management of classic CAH requires adequate glucocorticoid
replacement with hydrocortisone at supraphysiological doses.

Policy
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Crenessity for the treatment of classic CAH has been evaluated in
two pivotal studies.1,3,4 One study included pediatric patients and the other
included adults. Both studies required the patients to have a confirmed diagnosis
of CAH and to receive a stable dose of glucocorticoid of > 12 mg/m2/day in
hydrocortisone dose equivalents. In both studies, compared with placebo,
Crenessity significantly decreased serum androstenedione levels from baseline at
Week 4. In addition, compared with placebo, the total glucocorticoid dose while
androstenedione was controlled (≤ 120% of baseline or ≤ upper limit of normal)
was significantly reduced in the Crenessity group at Week 24.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Crenessity.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the
approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Crenessity as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, initial approval requires Crenessity to be prescribed by or in consultation
with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Crenessity™ (crinecerfont capsules and oral solution - Neurocrine
Biosciences)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Classic Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH). Approve for the duration
noted if the patient meets ONE of the following (A and B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets ALL of the
following (i, ii, and iii):
i. Patient is ≥ 4 years of age; AND
ii. Patient meets BOTH of the following (a and b):
a) The medication will be taken in combination with a systemic
glucocorticoid; AND
Note: Examples of glucocorticoids include hydrocortisone, prednisone,
prednisolone, or dexamethasone.
b) Patients has a diagnosis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency CAH confirmed
by ONE of the following [(1), (2), (3), or (4)]:
(1) Elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level; OR
(2) Confirmed cytochrome (CYP)21A2 genotype; OR
(3) Positive newborn screening with confirmatory second-tier
testing; OR

(4) Diagnostic results after cosyntropin stimulation; AND
iii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an endocrinologist,
urologist, or a physician who specializes in the treatment of adrenal
hyperplasia.
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Crenessity. Approve for 1 year if, according to
the prescriber, the patient is continuing to derive benefit from Crenessity.
Note: Examples of responses to Crenessity therapy are reduced
androstenedione levels, decreased 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels, or
reduction in glucocorticoid dose from baseline (i.e., prior to Crenessity
therapy) or improved or stabilized clinical signs/symptoms of classic
Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (e.g., decrease in body mass index standard
deviation scores, improved insulin resistance, reduction of hirsutism, or
improvement in androstenedione-to-testosterone ratio).
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Crenessity™ (crinecerfont capsules and oral solution - Neurocrine

is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s); criteria will be updated as new published data are available.
