INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Sotyktu, a tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor, is indicated for treatment of moderate
to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or
phototherapy.1 Limitation of use: Sotyktu is not recommended in combination with
potent immunosuppressants.
Guidelines
Guidelines have not been updated to address Sotyktu. Joint guidelines from the
American Academy of Dermatology and National Psoriasis Medical Board (2019) have
been published for management of psoriasis with biologics.2 These guidelines list all
the biologics approved at the time of publication as agents that may be used as
monotherapy for adults with moderate to severe psoriasis. Guidelines from the
European Dermatology Forum (2015) recommend biologics (i.e., etanercept,
adalimumab, infliximab, Stelara [ustekinumab subcutaneous injection]) as second-
line therapy for induction and long-term treatment if phototherapy and conventional
systemic agents have failed, are contraindicated, or are not tolerated.3
POLICY STATEMENT
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Sotyktu Prior Authorization
Policy
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Sotyktu.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with Sotyktu as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-
term efficacy, initial approval requires Sotyktu to be prescribed by or in consultation
with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated. All approvals are for
the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is authorized in months, 1
month is equal to 30 days.
• Sotyktu™ (deucravacitinib tablets ( Bristol Myers Squibb)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Plaque Psoriasis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of
the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 3 months if the patient meets ALL of the following
(i, ii, and iii):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):
a) Patient has tried at least one traditional systemic agent for psoriasis for
at least 3 months, unless intolerant; OR
Note: Examples of one traditional systemic agent include methotrexate,
cyclosporine, or acitretin tablets. A 3-month trial of psoralen plus
ultraviolet A light (PUVA) also counts. An exception to the requirement
for a trial of one traditional systemic agent for psoriasis can be made if
the patient has already had a 3-month trial or previous intolerance to at
least one biologic other than the requested drug. A biosimilar of the
requested biologic does not count. Refer to Appendix for examples of
biologics used for plaque psoriasis. A patient who has already tried a
biologic for psoriasis is not required to “step back” and try a traditional
systemic agent for psoriasis.
b) Patient has a contraindication to methotrexate, as determined by the
prescriber; AND
iii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a dermatologist.
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Sotyktu. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
ALL of the following (i, ii, and iii):
i. Patient has been established on therapy for at least 3 months; AND
Note: A patient who has received < 3 months of therapy or who is
restarting therapy is reviewed under criterion A (Initial Therapy).
ii. Patient experienced a beneficial clinical response, defined as improvement
from baseline (prior to initiating the requested drug) in at least one of the
following: estimated body surface area, erythema, induration/thickness,
and/or scale of areas affected by psoriasis; AND
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Sotyktu Prior Authorization
Policy
iii. Compared with baseline (prior to initiating the requested drug), patient
experienced an improvement in at least one symptom, such as decreased
pain, itching, and/or burning.
CONDITIONS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR APPROVAL
• Sotyktu™ (deucravacitinib tablets ( Bristol Myers Squibb)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for
an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events
and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination
with this medication.
2. Concurrent use with Other Potent Immunosuppressants, Including
Methotrexate.1 Co-administration with other potent immunosuppressive drugs
has the risk of added immunosuppression and has not been evaluated.
