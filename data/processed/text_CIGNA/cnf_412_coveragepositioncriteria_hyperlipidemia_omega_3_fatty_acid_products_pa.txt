INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Lovaza, a combination of ethyl esters of omega-3 fatty acids (mainly
eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and Vascepa, an
ethyl ester of EPA, are indicated for hypertriglyceridemia (severe, triglyceride
[TG] levels ≥ 500 mg/dL), to reduce TG levels as an adjunct to diet in adults.1,2
Vascepa is also indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke,
coronary revascularization, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization in
adults with elevated TG levels (≥ 150 mg/dL) and either established cardiovascular
(CV) disease or diabetes mellitus with two or more additional risk factors for CV
disease, as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy.2,3
Lovaza and Vascepa have been studied in patients with TG levels ≥ 200 mg/dL and
< 500 mg/dL and who have persistently high TGs despite treatment with statin
therapy and proper dietary modifications.4,5 In short-term trials lasting 6 to 12
weeks in duration, the addition of omega-3 fatty acid therapy led to further
reductions in TG levels.

Guidelines/Scientific Statements
Several guidelines are available that discuss the management of elevated TG levels
and have incorporated omega-3 fatty acid products.6-11 Highlights from a few
guidelines are below.
• The American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on
the Management of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk
Reduction in Patients with Persistent Hypertriglyceridemia (2021)
recommends Vascepa in a variety of clinical scenarios in patients with
persistent fasting hypertriglyceridemia (150 to 499 mg/dL).6 Also, Lovaza
and Vascepa are recommended in several circumstances in which patients
have very elevated TG levels (≥ 500 mg/dL).
• The American Diabetes Association Standards of Care (2025) state that
Vascepa should be considered to reduce CV risk for patients with ASCVD or
other CV risk factors who are on a statin with controlled low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels but with elevated TG levels (150 to 499
mg/dL).10
• The National Lipid Association (NLA) published a scientific statement
regarding Vascepa (2019).11 Based on the REDUCE-IT trial, the NLA position
is that for patients ≥ 45 years of age with clinical ASCVD, or ≥ 50 years of
age with diabetes mellitus requiring medication plus at least one additional
risk factor, with fasting TG levels of 135 to 499 mg/dL on high-intensity or
maximally tolerated statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe), treatment
with Vascepa is recommended for ASCVD risk reduction (Class I evidence
rating).
