CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ivermectin tablets (Stromectol, generic), an anthelmintic, are indicated for the treatment of
intestinal (i.e., non-disseminated) strongyloidiasis due to the nematode parasite
Strongyloides stercoralis and for the treatment of onchocerciasis due to the nematode
parasite Onchocerca volvulus.1 Ivermectin tablets do not have any activity against adult O.
volvulus parasites and surgical excision of O. volvulus nodules is the recommended
treatment.
The prescribing information notes that ivermectin tablets are given as a single oral dose for
these two indications.1 However, other sources note that ivermectin tablets should be given
for 2 days for the treatment of strongyloidiasis.1-3
Off-Label Uses
Ivermectin has been used for many parasitic infections (off-label).2,3-6 The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes ivermectin tablets as a treatment option for the
following: ascariasis, gnathostomiasis, hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans,
pediculosis (pediculus humanus capitis, pediculus humanus corporis, and pediculosis pubis
[due to Phthirus pubis]), scabies, trichuriasis, and Wucheria bancrofti infection (a main
cause of lymphatic filariasis).7-15 There are data to support the use of ivermectin tablets for
the treatment of enterobiasis, Demodex folliculorum, Mansonella ozzardi and M.
streptocerca infections.6,16

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Stromectol® (ivermectin tablets (Merck, generic)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for ANY other use(s)
including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated
as new published data are available):
1. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The Infectious Disease Society of America
(IDSA) guidelines on the treatment of management of patients with COVID-19 (updated
2022) reviewed studies that assessed the efficacy of oral ivermectin in the treatment of
COVID-19.17 The IDSA reviewed data from several clinical trials and cited the following
findings: oral ivermectin did not reduce mortality; failed to demonstrate a beneficial or
detrimental effect on symptoms, hospitalization or viral clearance; and compared with
standard of care, oral ivermectin did not result in differences in all-cause mortality,
hospital length of stay, or the need for mechanical ventilation. The IDSA recommends
against the use of ivermectin for the treatment of COVID-19, except in clinical trials.
