COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW

Ustekinumab Intravenous Products Prior Authorization Policy
Ustekinumab intravenous, a monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of the
interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 cytokines, is indicated for the following conditions:1,6-12
• Crohn’s disease (CD), in adults with moderate to severe active disease.
• Ulcerative colitis (UC), in adults with moderate to severe active disease.
In CD and UC, a single weight-based dose is administered by intravenous (IV)
infusion. Following induction therapy with the IV product, the recommended
maintenance is ustekinumab subcutaneous (SC) injection, given as a 90 mg SC
injection administered 8 weeks after the initial IV dose, then once every 8 weeks
thereafter.
Guidelines
Guidelines for the treatment of inflammatory conditions recommend use of
ustekinumab.
• Crohn’s Disease: The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) [2025]
has guidelines for the management of CD in adults.2 In moderate to severe
disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be utilized for
induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended include tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, Entyvio® (vedolizumab), IL-23 inhibitors, IL-
12/23 inhibitors, and Rinvoq® (upadacitinib). If steroids are utilized for
induction, efforts should be made to introduce steroid-sparing agents for
maintenance therapy. Guidelines from the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) [2021] include various biologics among the therapies for
moderate to severe CD, for induction and maintenance of remission.13
• Ulcerative Colitis: The AGA (2024) and the ACG (2025) have clinical practice
guidelines on the management of moderate to severe UC.3,4 In moderate to
severe disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be utilized
for induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended include TNF
inhibitors, Entyvio, IL-23 inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, sphingosine-1-
phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. If
steroids are utilized for induction, efforts should be made to introduce steroid-
sparing agents for maintenance therapy. Of note, guidelines state
corticosteroids may be avoided entirely when other effective induction
strategies are planned.4 Both guidelines also recommend that any drug that
effectively treats induction should be continued for maintenance.

Ustekinumab Intravenous Products Prior Authorization Policy
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of ustekinumab
intravenous. Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis
of patients treated with ustekinumab intravenous as well as the monitoring required
for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires ustekinumab
intravenous to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated. All approvals are provided for 30 days, which is an
adequate duration for the patient to receive one dose.

is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Crohn’s Disease. Approve a single dose if the patient meets ALL of the following
(A, B, C, and D):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) The medication will be used as induction therapy; AND
C) Patient meets ONE of the following (i, ii, iii, or iv):
i. Patient has tried or is currently taking a systemic corticosteroid, or a
systemic corticosteroid is contraindicated in this patient; OR
ii. Patient has tried one other conventional systemic therapy for Crohn’s
disease; OR
Note: Examples of conventional systemic therapy for Crohn’s disease
include azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate. An exception to
the requirement for a trial of or contraindication to steroids or a trial of one
other conventional systemic agent can be made if the patient has already
tried at least one biologic other than the requested medication. A biosimilar
of the requested biologic does not count. Refer to Appendix for examples
of biologics used for Crohn’s disease. A trial of mesalamine does not count
as a systemic agent for Crohn’s disease.
iii. Patient has enterocutaneous (perianal or abdominal) or rectovaginal
fistulas; OR
Page 3 of 8: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions -
Ustekinumab Intravenous Products Prior Authorization Policy
iv. Patient had ileocolonic resection (to reduce the chance of Crohn’s disease
recurrence); AND
D) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.
2. Ulcerative Colitis. Approve a single dose if the patient meets ALL of the
following (A, B, and C):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) The medication will be used as induction therapy; AND
C) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED

is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). There are other biologic therapies indicated in
AS. More data are needed to demonstrate efficacy of ustekinumab in this
condition. There is a published proof-of-concept trial evaluating ustekinumab in
AS (TOPAS – UsTekinumab for the treatment Of Patients with active Ankylosing
Spondylitis).4 TOPAS was a prospective, open-label study evaluating ustekinumab
90 mg subcutaneous at Week 0, 4, and 16 in patients (n = 20) with AS. After
Week 16, patients were followed through Week 28. Patients who previously failed
to respond to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) were excluded. The primary
endpoint was a 40% improvement in disease activity at Week 24 according to the
Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria (ASAS40)
in the intent-to-treat population which included all patients who received at least
one dose of ustekinumab. In all, 65% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI]:
41%, 85%; n = 13/20) achieved an ASAS40 response at Week 24. There was at
least a 50% improvement of the BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease
Activity Index) achieved by 55% of patients (95% CI: 32%, 77%; n = 11/20).
However, enthesitis (measured by MASES [Maastricht AS Entheses Score] and
SPARCC [SPondyloArthritis Research Consortium of Canada] enthesitis indices)
and the number of swollen joints were not significantly improved at Week 24.
Page 4 of 8: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions -
Ustekinumab Intravenous Products Prior Authorization Policy
There was a significant reduction of active inflammation on magnetic resonance
imaging at Week 24 compared with baseline in sacroiliac joints.
2. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination
with this medication.
3. Plaque Psoriasis. Ustekinumab for subcutaneous injection is indicated for
treatment of plaque psoriasis.1 Appropriate dosing of ustekinumab intravenous
in plaque psoriasis is unclear.
4. Psoriatic Arthritis. Ustekinumab for subcutaneous injection is indicated for
treatment of psoriatic arthritis.1 Appropriate dosing of ustekinumab intravenous
in psoriatic arthritis is unclear.
