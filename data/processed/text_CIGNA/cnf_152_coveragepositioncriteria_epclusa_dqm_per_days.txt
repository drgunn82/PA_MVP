INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
The fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleotide
analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor, and velpatasvir, an HCV NS5A inhibitor, is
indicated for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 through 6 infection in
patients ≥ 3 years of age.1
Dosing
The FDA-approved duration of therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is 12 weeks for
all patients.1 In patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or C),
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is administered with weight-based ribavirin.
In adults, the recommended dose is one tablet (400 mg/100 mg) once daily (QD).1
In pediatric patients ≥ 3 years of age, dosing is weight-based (Table 1).

Availability
Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa, generic) is available as a fixed-dose combination
tablet of sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg.1 Epclusa (brand only) is also
available as fixed-dose combination tablet of sofosbuvir 200 mg/velpatasvir 50 mg
as well as film-coated oral pellets of sofosbuvir 200 mg/velpatasvir 50 mg and
sofosbuvir 150 mg/velpatasvir 37.5 mg.
Guidelines
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommendations
provide information regarding a longer duration of treatment (beyond 12 weeks) for
certain circumstances.2 Although Vosevi® (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir
tablets) is recommended in most instances for adults with no cirrhosis or
compensated cirrhosis who have failed treatment with a sofosbuvir-containing
regimen, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is recommended in adults (genotypes 1 through 6)
with decompensated cirrhosis who have failed therapy with a sofosbuvir-containing
regimen. In this setting, AASLD guidelines recommend sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for
24 weeks in combination with ribavirin. Data are limited to one Phase II study
where sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was studied in patients with genotype 1, 2, and 3 who
did not respond to velpatasvir-containing regimens including sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
and Vosevi.2,3 Retreatment with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir + ribavirin for 24 weeks
yielded high overall response rates (sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-
treatment [SVR12] 91% [n = 63/69]). Among patients with genotype 1 chronic
HCV, 97% of patients (n = 36/37) achieved SVR12. In patients with genotype 2
chronic HCV, SVR12 was attained in 95% of patients (n = 13/14) and in patients
with genotype 3 chronic HCV, SVR12 was attained in 78% of patients (n = 14/18).
Baseline NS5A resistance associated substitutions did not appear to impact SVR
rates. No breakdown of the proportion of patients with decompensated cirrhosis
was provided in the study.
POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to prevent
stockpiling, misuse and/or overuse of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (Epclusa, generic). If
the Drug Quantity Management rule is not met for the requested medication at the
point of service, coverage will be determined by the Criteria below. All approvals
are provided for the duration noted below.
