CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Gimoti, a dopamine-2 receptor antagonist, is indicated for the relief of symptoms
associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis in adults.1
Limitations of Use: Gimoti is not recommended for use in pediatric patients due to
the risk of tardive dyskinesia and other extrapyramidal symptoms as well as the
risk of methemoglobinemia in neonates.1 Gimoti is not recommended for use in
patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C),
moderate or severe renal impairment (creatine clearance < 60 mL/min), and in
patients concurrently using strong cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 inhibitors due to the
risk of increased drug exposure and adverse reactions.
Disease Overview
Gastroparesis is a disorder of the upper gastrointestinal tract characterized by
delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction.2 Women are
affected by gastroparesis in a 4:1 ratio. The disorder is estimated to affect
approximately 5% of patients with type 1 diabetes and 1% of patients with type 2
diabetes.3 Diabetic gastroparesis is caused by autonomic neuropathy and is more
likely to occur in individuals with poor glycemic control. Symptoms include nausea,
vomiting, and early satiety which reduces the quality of life in impacted patients.5

Refractory symptoms of gastroparesis may require hospitalization for the treatment
of symptoms and dehydration, and to achieve glucose control.
Metoclopramide stimulates motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without
stimulating gastric, biliary, or pancreatic secretions; however, the exact mechanism
of action in the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis has not been fully established.1
Metoclopramide appears to sensitize tissues to the effects of acetylcholine and is
inhibited by anticholinergic medications. Metoclopramide increases gastric
contractions, relaxes the pyloric sphincter and duodenal bulb, and increases
peristalsis of the duodenum and jejunum resulting in accelerated gastric emptying
and small bowel transit time.1,5 Metoclopramide also increases the resting tone of
the lower esophageal sphincter but has little to no effect on the motility of the colon
or gallbladder. In addition, metoclopramide has antiemetic actions as an antagonist
to dopamine receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone.
Safety
Gimoti has a Boxed Warning regarding tardive dyskinesia (TD).1 TD is syndrome of
potentially irreversible and disfiguring involuntary movements of the face or
tongue, and sometimes of the trunk and/or extremities. The risk of developing TD
from treatment with metoclopramide is increased in the elderly, especially elderly
women, and in patients with diabetes mellitus. The likelihood that TD will develop
and become irreversible increases with duration of treatment with metoclopramide
and total cumulative dosage. Avoid treatment with metoclopramide (all dosage
forms and routes of administration) for longer than 12 weeks.
Additional Warnings/Precautions associated with Gimoti include other
extrapyramidal symptoms; neuroleptic malignant syndrome; depression and
suicidal ideation/suicide; hypertension; fluid retention; hyperprolactinemia; effects
on the ability to drive and operate machinery; and the risk of adverse reactions in
patients with moderate or severe renal or hepatic impairment, CYP2D6 poor
metabolizers, and patients taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors.
Gimoti is contraindicated in patients with a history of TD or a dystonic reaction to
metoclopramide; when stimulation of gastrointestinal motility might be dangerous
(e.g. in the presence of gastrointestinal hemorrhage, mechanical obstruction, or
perforation); in patients with pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-releasing
paragangliomas; in patients with epilepsy; and in patients with hypersensitivity to
metoclopramide. Of note, Gimoti is also not recommended as initial therapy in
patients ≥ 65 years of age.
Guidelines
The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) clinical guidelines for
gastroparesis (2022) state that pharmacologic treatment should be considered in
patients with idiopathic and diabetic gastroparesis to improve gastric emptying and
gastroparesis symptoms while considering the benefits and risks of treatment (low
evidence, conditional recommendation).2 ACG suggests treatment with
metoclopramide over no treatment for the management of refractory symptoms of
gastroparesis (low evidence, conditional recommendation). The guidelines do not
4 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Gastroenterology – Gimoti Prior Authorization Policy
make specific recommendations regarding utilization between available dosage
forms of metoclopramide (injection, tablets, or nasal spray).
POLICY STATEMENT
Due insufficient clinical efficacy data, approval is not recommended for Gimoti.
The current Gimoti efficacy information is insufficient to determine if the medication
demonstrates any clinically meaningful benefits.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Gimoti® (metoclopramide nasal spray - Evoke)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY use(s) including the
following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as new
published data are available):
1. Diabetic gastroparesis. Due to the lack of clinically significant efficacy data,
approval is not recommended for Gimoti.
Gimoti was approved by the FDA under the 505(b)(2) pathway relying on
existing safety and efficacy data for oral metoclopramide.1 No pivotal data with
Gimoti are included in the prescribing information. The data leveraged with oral
metoclopramide tablets are from US approval in 1979, involved small sample
sizes, and with a short duration of therapy (< 4 weeks).
A recently published (2024), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group,
multicenter, Phase III study was conducted in adult females who were 18 to 75
years of age with a diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes and symptoms of
gastroparesis and delayed gastric emptying (n = 205).4 Patients were
randomized 1:1 to receive metoclopramide nasal spray 10 mg or placebo for a
28 day treatment period. Of note, Gimoti is available in a 15 mg nasal spray
and a 10 mg nasal spray is not commercially available. Enrolled patients were
mostly White (69%), postmenopausal, and < 65 years of age. The average age
of patients was 52.7 years and the majority had type 2 diabetes (88%). The
primary efficacy end point was the change in mean daily Gastroparesis
Symptom Assessment total score from baseline to Week 4. The Gastroparesis
Symptom Assessment daily diary is a patient-reported outcome questionnaire
that averages scores of nausea, early satiety, prolonged fullness, bloating, and
upper abdominal pain on a 5-point scale. The daily Gastroparesis Symptom
Assessment total score is the average of the individual symptom scores during
the treatment period. The mean daily Gastroparesis Symptom Assessment total
score at baseline was 2.29 and a score > 2.7 was considered indicative of
moderate to severe symptoms. Approximately half of all enrolled patients
(49%) had not previously tried any diabetic gastroparesis treatment. Overall,
the primary endpoint was not reached in the study as the metoclopramide nasal
4 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Gastroenterology – Gimoti Prior Authorization Policy
spray group did not experience a significant reduction in symptoms compared
with the placebo group from baseline to Week 4 (P = 0.881). In a post hoc
analysis, approximately 100 patients with moderate to severe symptoms at
baseline had a significant treatment effect from Weeks 1 to 3 (P < 0.05) and
experienced a significant reduction in nausea and upper abdominal pain for all 4
Weeks compared with placebo (P < 0.05). There were 190 patients who
completed the study. The most common reasons for discontinuation were
occurrence of adverse events, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or
abnormal electrocardiograms. In general, adverse events were considered mild
to moderate with headache and abdominal pain reported most frequently over
28-day treatment period. Examples of limitations of the study include the
patient population, which was limited to only women in the United States, and
the dose of the metoclopramide nasal spray evaluated (10 mg) is not
commercially available. The study also used a different gastroparesis symptom
scale from each of the Phase II studies which evaluated metoclopramide nasal
spray and are briefly summarized below. Current FDA guidelines suggest a 12-
week study period for efficacy results, yet metoclopramide is not recommended
for a treatment duration longer than 12 weeks. The study duration was 4 weeks
which may be too short to identify TD as an adverse event or efficacy. Also, the
post hoc analysis results for the moderate to severe subgroup were not powered
for statistical significance.
A previously published (2014), open-label, active-controlled, parallel-group,
multicenter, Phase IIa study was performed in adults with a diagnosis of type 1
or type 2 diabetes and diabetic gastroparesis who were randomized to
metoclopramide 10 mg or 20 mg nasal spray, or 10 mg oral tablets (3:3:1,
respectively) for 6 Weeks (n = 89).5 The primary efficacy endpoint was the
change from baseline to Day 42 in the total symptom score. The total symptom
score consisted of the sum of a patient-reported questionnaire regarding
symptoms of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, bloating, early satiety, and
persistent fullness and an investigator-scored symptom severity rating from 0 to
4 (none, mild, moderate, marked, or severe; respectively). Metoclopramide 20
mg nasal spray demonstrated significantly greater improvement in symptom
control from baseline to Week 6 compared to the oral 10 mg tablet (P = 0.026).
A pharmacokinetic analysis indicated comparable rates of rapid absorption of
metoclopramide on Day 1 following a single treatment dose and on Day 42 for
all three treatment groups. There were no statistically significant differences
identified between the pharmacokinetic parameters of the nasal spray and oral
tablet groups.
A subsequently published (2015), double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group, dose-ranging, multicenter, Phase IIb study was completed in adults with
diabetic gastroparesis (n = 285).6 Adult patients ≤ 75 years of age were
randomized 1:1:1 to metoclopramide nasal spray 10 mg, 14 mg, or placebo for
4 weeks. The primary endpoint was in the change from baseline to Week 4 in
the modified Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index-Daily Dairy which consisted
of 4 patient-reported symptoms (nausea, bloating, early satiety and upper
abdominal pain). There was no statistically significant difference in reduction of
4 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Gastroenterology – Gimoti Prior Authorization Policy
symptoms between the metoclopramide groups and placebo group. A subgroup
analysis indicated a significant difference in female patients between placebo
and both dose groups of metoclopramide nasal spray (P = 0.0215). In contrast,
notably male patients had a greater decrease in the gastroparesis symptom
scores in the placebo group than metoclopramide groups.
2. Gastroesophageal reflux. Gimoti has not been evaluated for the treatment of
gastroesophageal reflux disease.1
3. Coverage is not recommended for circumstances not listed in the Recommended
Authorization Criteria. Criteria will be updated as new published data are
available.
