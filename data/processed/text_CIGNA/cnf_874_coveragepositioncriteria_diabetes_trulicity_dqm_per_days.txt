INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Trulicity, a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist, is indicated:1
• As an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adult and
pediatric patients ≥ 10 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
• To reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events
(cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke) in
adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have established cardiovascular
disease or multiple cardiovascular risk factors.
Dosing
Adult Dosing
The recommended initial dose of Trulicity is 0.75 mg administered subcutaneously
(SC) once weekly (QW).1 The dose should be increased to 1.5 mg SC QW for
additional glycemic control. After 4 weeks on the current dose, may increase the
dose in 1.5 mg increments if additional glycemic control is needed. The maximum
dose of Trulicity is 4.5 mg SC QW.
Pediatric Dosing
Page 1 of 3 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Diabetes – Trulicity Drug Quantity Management Policy
– Per Days
The recommended initial dose of Trulicity is 0.75 mg SC QW.1 The dose may be
increased to the maximum dose of 1.5 mg SC QW after at least 4 weeks on the
0.75 mg dose, if additional glycemic control is needed.
Missed Doses
If a dose of Trulicity is missed, the dose should be administered as soon as possible
if there are at least 3 days (72 hours) until the next scheduled dose. If there are
less than 3 days prior to the next scheduled dose, the missed dose should be
skipped and administered on the regularly scheduled day. In either scenario,
patients may then resume their regular dosing schedule. The day of administration
can be changed if needed, provided the last dose was administered 3 or more days
before the new day of administration.
