INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
The non-stimulant medications are indicated for the treatment of attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years
of age.1-5
• Atomoxetine capsules (Strattera, generic) and Qelbree are also indicated for
the treatment of ADHD in adults.1,4
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Non-Stimulant
Medications Step Therapy Policy
Numerous stimulants are approved for the treatment of ADHD in children and
adolescents, as well as adults.6-8
GUIDELINES
The American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis,
evaluation, and treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents (2019) indicates
that stimulants have the most evidence for efficacy and safety in the treatment of
ADHD, and remain the first choice of medication treatment.9 The evidence is
particularly strong for stimulant medications and sufficient but less strong for
atomoxetine, extended-release guanfacine, and extended-release clonidine (in that
order) [strong recommendation]. Qelbree is not addressed in the guideline.
A meta-analysis of 133 double-blind, randomized, controlled trials (published in
2018) found that all included medications (amphetamines, methylphenidate,
atomoxetine, bupropion, clonidine, guanfacine, and modafinil) were superior to
placebo for clinicians’ ratings of ADHD core symptoms in children and adolescents.10
When evaluating teachers' ratings, only methylphenidate and modafinil were more
efficacious than placebo. In clinicians' ratings of adults, amphetamines,
methylphenidate, bupropion, and atomoxetine, but not modafinil, demonstrated
improvements over placebo. With respect to tolerability, amphetamines were
inferior to placebo in children, adolescents, and adults; guanfacine was inferior to
placebo in children and adolescents only; and atomoxetine, methylphenidate, and
modafinil were less well-tolerated than placebo in adults only. In head-to-head
comparisons, differences in efficacy (based on clinicians' ratings) were found that
favored amphetamines over modafinil, atomoxetine, and methylphenidate in
children, adolescents, and adults. Taking into account both efficacy and safety,
evidence from this meta-analysis supports the use of methylphenidate in children
and adolescents and amphetamines in adults, as preferred first-line medications for
treatment of ADHD.
DOSING AND DOSAGE FORMS
The choice of formulation depends on factors such as the efficacy of each agent for
a given child/adolescent, the preferred length of coverage time, whether a child can
swallow tablets or capsules, and expense.9 Many of the extended-release (ER)
stimulant medications for the treatment of ADHD are available as capsules:
amphetamine/dextroamphetamine ER capsules (Adderall XR, generic; Mydayis,
generic), dexmethylphenidate ER capsules (Focalin XR, generic), lisdexamfetamine
capsules (Vyvanse, generic), and methylphenidate ER capsules (Metadate CD,
generic; Ritalin LA, generic; Adhansia XR; Aptensio XR). According to the
prescribing information, the capsules may be taken whole, or opened and the entire
contents sprinkled on applesauce.11-16 Patients should take the applesauce with
sprinkled beads in its entirety without chewing. Of note, generic atomoxetine
capsules must be swallowed whole.1
