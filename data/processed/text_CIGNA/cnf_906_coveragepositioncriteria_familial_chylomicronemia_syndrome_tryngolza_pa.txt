CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Tryngolza, an apolipoprotein C-III (APO-III)-directed antisense oligonucleotide, is
indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglycerides in adults with familial
chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS).1 It is recommended to maintain a low-fat diet
(≤ 20 grams of fat per day) in conjunction with Tryngolza.
Disease Overview
FCS is an ultrarare, genetic form of severe hypertriglyceridemia that impacts 1 to
10 per 1,000,000 persons in the US. Patients with FCS may have triglyceride levels
in the thousands. Of note, normal triglyceride levels are < 150 mg/dL with levels
above 500 mg/dL categorized as severe hypertriglyceridemia. In general, patients
with FCS do not have adequate responses to triglyceride-lowering therapies (e.g.,
fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids). The high triglyceride levels lead to symptoms such
as severe abdominal pain, inflammation of the pancreas (acute pancreatitis), and
fatty deposits in the skin. Lipemia retinalis may occur, a condition in which the
retinal veins of the eyes appear milky. Patients may develop symptoms of FCS in
infancy but may not have the disease be known until adulthood. FCS is caused by
biallelic pathogenic variants in five known genes (i.e., lipoprotein lipase [LPL],
glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-binding

protein 1 [GPIHBP1], apolipoprotein A-V [APOA5], apolipoprotein C-II [APOC2], or
lipase maturation factor 1 [LMF1]).
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Tryngolza was evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled,
double-blind, Phase III trial in patients with genetically identified FCS.1,2 A fasting
triglyceride level ≥ 880 mg/dL was required. At study entry, patients who received
the FDA-approved dose of Tryngolza (n = 22) had baseline mean triglyceride levels
of 2,613 mg/dL; the value for this parameter in patients who received placebo (n =
23) was 2,585 mg/dL. Background medications were statins (27%), omega-3 fatty
acids (42%), fibrates (49%), or other lipid-lowering therapies (13%). The
difference between Tryngolza 80 mg and placebo in the percent change in fasting
triglycerides from baseline to Month 6 was -42.5%.
Guidelines
Guidelines do not address Tryngolza. There are recommendations regarding the
diagnosis and/or identification of FCS.3,4 An expert panel (2018) states the FCS is
characterized by very high plasma triglyceride concentrations (> 885 mg/dL) in the
untreated state.3 Patients with FCS experience physical complications including
incapacitating abdominal pain, and severe recurrent acute pancreatitis. Other
clinical symptoms include eruptive xanthomas, lipemia retinalis, and lower body
weight. Neurologic symptoms may be present (e.g., irritability, memory problems,
dementia). Pathogenic variants are also present in FCS-genes (i.e., LPL, GPIHBP1,
APOA5, APOC2, or LMF1). An FSC score ≥ 10 is a strong predictor of the
condition.3 Also, patients with a North America Familial Chylomicronemia
Syndrome (NAFCS) score ≥ 45 are very likely to have classical FCS.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Tryngolza.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with Tryngolza as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and
long-term efficacy, initial approval requires Tryngolza to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
Documentation: Documentation is required for use of Tryngolza as noted in the
criteria as [documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not
limited to, chart notes, laboratory tests, medical test results, claims records,
prescription receipts, and/or other information.

Characteristics Categories and Definitions for Patient Scenarios
Included in Patient
Scenarios
Patient Age • Adult: ≥ 20 years of age
• Adolescent: ≥ 10 to 19 years of age
• Child: ≥ 1 to 9 years of age
• Infant: < 1 year of age
Hypertriglyceridemia Defined as Hypertriglyceridemia ≥ 440 mg/dL, categorized into early vs.
Onset late onset.
• Early onset: In infancy or childhood
• Later onset: In adolescence or adulthood
Body Mass Index • ≥ 25.0 kg/m2 in adults or ≥ 85th percentile in children/adolescents
• < 25 kg/m2 in adults or < 85th percentile in children/adolescents
Abdominal Pain/ In all scenarios, panelists assumed symptoms were related to
Pancreatitis chylomicronemia in a patient.
• No history of abdominal pain or pancreatitis
• Recurrent abdominal pain but no history of pancreatitis
• History of pancreatitis (with or without abdominal pain)
Secondary Factors Defined as factors that may contribute to the patient’s
hypertriglyceridemia. For example, lifestyle factors (e.g., high alcohol
intake, ultra-processed diet), clinical conditions (e.g., non-pancreatitis
induced diabetes, HIV), medications (e.g., antidepressants, antiretrovirals).*
• ≥ One secondary factor
• No secondary factors
Fasting TG Levels Defined fasting as routine fasting (e.g., 6 to 12 hours depending on patient
age) prior to outpatient laboratory tests. Panelists assumed it did not
include a scenario in which the patient had been fasting during a
hospitalization for many days to control acute pancreatitis or in attempts to
bring TG levels down. Panelists also assumed the patient was not yet
complying with severe dietary fat restriction (< 20 g/day for adults, < 10%
calories from fat for adolescents and children). We categorized the last
three laboratory values for adults and on the last two laboratory values for
children into two categories:
• Not all severely elevated: one to two TG readings 440 to 880 mg/dL,
remainder > 880 mg/dL.
• All severely elevated: all TG readings > 880 mg/dL
TG/TC Ratio Defined as the ratio of TG over TC, categorized into:
• Normal/low: ≤ 8 mg/dL
• High: > 8 mg/dL
ApoB Reading ApoB laboratory value, categorized into:
• Normal/high: ≥ 1 g/L
• Low: < 1.0 g/L (100 mg/dL)
Treatment Non- In all scenarios describing patients ≥10 years old, panelists assumed
Response fibrates and high-dose omega-3 fatty acids did not produce a sustained
response in TG levels even when the patient was compliant with therapy
(i.e., TG levels do not decrease by 20% or more from these treatments and
do not remain reduced).
† This tool can be used to assist in the diagnosis of familial chylomicronemia syndrome. It should be
utilized in patients ≥ 1 year of age with triglyceride (TG) levels ≥ 440 mg/dL. It may be useful in
patients who have not been yet tested genetically for FCS, or in whom genetic testing was inconclusive.
If patients ≥ 10 years of age, the tool should only be used for patients who are not responsive to fibrates
and high-dose omega-3 fatty acids even when the patient is compliance with therapy; HIV – Human
immunodeficiency virus; * A more comprehensive list of secondary factors are available; TG –
Triglyceride; TC – Total cholesterol; ApoB – Apolipoprotein B.
