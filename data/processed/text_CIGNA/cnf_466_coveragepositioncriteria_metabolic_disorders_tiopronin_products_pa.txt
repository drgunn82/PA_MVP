INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Tiopronin products are indicated, in combination with high fluid intake, alkali, and
diet modification, for the prevention of cystine kidney stone formation in adults and
pediatric patients ≥ 20 kg with severe homozygous cystinuria, who are not
responsive to these measures alone.1,2,6 Amongst the tiopronin delayed-release
formulations, Venxxiva is a branded generic product and is supplied in the same
dosage strength as Thiola EC.
Disease Overview
Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder of abnormal cystine transport.3 The
estimated prevalence is 1:7,000 to 1:10,000 individuals in the US. Excessive
undissolved cystine in the urine leads to formation of stones in the kidney, bladder,
and/or ureter. Symptoms typically begin to manifest between 10 and 30 years of
age, although elevated cystine excretion may be found in infancy. Diagnosis is made
clinically based on quantitative urinary cystine assays; genetic testing is not routine
as it does not change medical management.4 Homozygotes exhibit urinary cystine

Authorization Policy
excretion > 300 to 400 mg/L/day, whereas heterozygotes have intermediate urinary
cystine excretion. Treatment is directed at decreasing urinary cystine concentration
(generally targeting a urine cystine < 250 mg/L) and enhancing solubility.4,5,7
Tiopronin products work by binding to cystine and increasing urinary solubility.4
Guidelines
According to the American Urological Association guideline for medical management
of kidney stones (2014, confirmed 2019), all patients with cystine kidney stones
should be encouraged to drink large amounts of fluid to maintain low urinary cystine
concentrations; often volumes of 4 liters per day are required.5 Recommended
dietary modifications include restriction of sodium and animal proteins. Alkalization
of urine is also used to improve cystine solubility. This can be achieved through
increased fruit and vegetable intake and/or with medications such as potassium
citrate. The guideline recommends tiopronin for patients with cystine kidney stones
who are unresponsive to increased fluid intake, dietary modification, and urinary
alkalization. Captopril, another thiol agent, has not been shown to be effective for
the prevention of recurrent cystine stones. D-penicillamine may be associated with
more adverse events and is not preferred.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of tiopronin
products. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
tiopronin products as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-
term efficacy, approval requires tiopronin products to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
