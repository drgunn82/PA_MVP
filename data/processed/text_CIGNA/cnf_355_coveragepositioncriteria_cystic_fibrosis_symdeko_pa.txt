ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE

CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Symdeko is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients ≥ 6 years
of age who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who have at least one
mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene
that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro data and/or clinical
evidence.1
If the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be
used to detect the presence of a CFTR mutation followed by verification with bi-
directional sequencing when recommended by the mutation test instructions for use.
Table 1 lists the responsive CFTR mutations based on: 1) a clinical forced expiratory
volume in 1 second (FEV ) response and/or 2) in vitro data in Fischer rat thyroid cells,
1
indicating that tezacaftor/ivacaftor increases chloride transport to ≥ 10% of
untreated normal over baseline. CFTR gene mutations that are not responsive to
Kalydeco® (ivacaftor granule or tablet) alone are not expected to respond to Symdeko
except for F508del homozygotes.

CFTR – Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; * A patient must have two copies of the

Guidelines
The most current treatment recommendations are the Standards of Care for CFTR
variant-specific therapy for people with CF, from the European Cystic Fibrosis Society
(2023).2 However, the Standards do not reflect the currently approved age
indications for Kalydeco® (ivacaftor tablets and oral granules) [≥ 1 months of age],
Orkambi® [lumacaftor/ivacaftor tablets and oral granules] (≥ 1 year of age), or
Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor; ivacaftor co-packaged tablets and
granules) [≥ 2 years of age]. In general, Trikafta is recommended over other agents
where indications overlap. The Standards recommend Trikafta in patients ≥ 6 years
of age with CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for F508del. In patients with
one or more responsive non-F508del variant, Kalydeco, Symdeko, or Trikafta are
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator –
Symdeko Prior Authorization Policy
recommended. Kalydeco is recommended in patients ≥ 4 months of age with eligible
CFTR gene variants. Orkambi is recommended for patients 2 to 5 years of age who
are homozygous for F508del. Of note, the Standards state that after diagnosis,
repeat sweat testing provides evidence of treatment effect on CFTR activity, but does
not predict clinical response. The European Cystic Fibrosis Society Standards for
establishing and maintaining health (2024) note that people with CF with eligible
CFTR gene variants should be offered CFTR modulator therapy.5
According to the CF Foundation (2017), CF is diagnosed when an individual has both
a clinical presentation of CF and evidence of CFTR dysfunction.3,4 Clinical presentation
of CF includes a positive newborn screening, signs and/or symptoms of CF, and/or
family history of CF. To establish a diagnosis of CF, sweat chloride tests should be
considered first, then CFTR genetic analysis (CFTR genotype), and then CFTR
physiologic tests (nasal potential difference [NPD] or intestinal current measurement
[ICM]). However, tests of CFTR function are not always done in this order. All
individuals diagnosed with CF should have a sweat chloride test and CFTR genetic
analysis performed.
In a patient with a sweat chloride test ≥ 60 mmol/L, CF diagnosis is established and
in patients with a sweat chloride test < 30 mmol/L, a diagnosis of CF is unlikely.3,4
Rarely, patients with a sweat chloride < 30 mmol/L may be considered to have CF if
alternatives are excluded and other confirmatory tests (genetic and physiologic
testing) support a CF diagnosis. In patients with a sweat chloride test of ≥ 30 to <
60 mmol/L, CFTR genetic analysis is undertaken. If the genetic analysis identifies
two CF-causing CFTR mutations, CF is diagnosed; if no CFTR mutations are identified,
a diagnosis of CF is unlikely. In patients with a CFTR genotype that is undefined or
of varying clinical consequence, full gene CFTR sequencing (if not already performed)
or CFTR physiologic testing is performed (NPD or ICM). If only one CFTR variant is
identified on limited analysis, full gene CFTR sequencing should be performed. CF is
possible if both alleles possess CF-causing, undefined, or mutation of varying clinical
consequence mutations; CF is unlikely if only no CF-causing mutations are found. If
results of the NPD or ICM show CFTR dysfunction, CF is diagnosed; when testing is
unavailable or equivocal, the diagnosis of CF is not resolved, and when results of the
physiologic testing show CFTR function is preserved, a diagnosis of CF is considered
unlikely. It is recommended that patients with challenging diagnoses be evaluated
at an accredited CF Foundation Care Center.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Symdeko.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Symdeko as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and efficacy, approval requires
Symdeko to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated.
