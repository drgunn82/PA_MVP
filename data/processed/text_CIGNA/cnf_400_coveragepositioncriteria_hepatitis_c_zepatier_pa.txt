INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES

CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Zepatier is an oral fixed-dose combination tablet containing grazoprevir, a second-
generation protease inhibitor and elbasvir, an NS5A inhibitor.1 It is indicated with or
without ribavirin for the treatment of patients ≥ 12 years of age or weighing ≥ 30 kg
with genotype 1 or 4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV).1
Zepatier is contraindicated in patients with Child-Pugh B or C liver disease
(decompensated cirrhosis).1
Dosing
The duration of treatment is outlined below (Table 1). Prior to initiating Zepatier in
patients with genotype 1a infection, testing for the NS5A resistance-associated
polymorphism is recommended to guide treatment duration.1 In patients with
genotype 1a with the NS5A polymorphism present at baseline, 12 weeks of treatment
with Zepatier resulted in lower rates of sustained viral response 12 weeks after
treatment completion relative to patients with genotype 1a without the presence of
this baseline polymorphism.

Guidelines
According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
[December 2023], NS5A resistance-associated substitution testing is recommended
for treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced patients with genotype 1a chronic HCV
who are being considered for Zepatier.2 If the NS5A polymorphism is present, a
different regimen should be considered. Zepatier is recognized as an alternative
regimen in treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1a chronic HCV with or without
compensated cirrhosis, and a recommended treatment option in patients with
genotype 1b or 4 chronic HCV with or without compensated cirrhosis. It is also
recognized as an alternative regimen in treatment-naïve and non-direct-acting
antiviral-experienced kidney transplant patients with genotype 1 or 4 chronic HCV
with or without compensated cirrhosis. The pediatric portion of the guidelines have
not been updated since the approval of the lower age indication approved with
Zepatier.
The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition
recommendations on the treatment of hepatitis C (2024) describe the optimal
therapeutic management of adolescents and children with HCV infection.3 Direct-
acting antiviral regimens are recommended for all treatment-naïve and treatment-
experienced children ≥ 3 years of age with chronic HCV. When available, the regimen
of choice should be one that has the shortest treatment duration and does not require
concomitant ribavirin. In addition, to simplify treatment and avoid the need of
genotyping and/or baseline resistance‐associated substitutions assessment,
pangenotypic regimens are preferred.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Zepatier. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hepatitis C – Zepatier Prior Authorization Policy
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Zepatier as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Zepatier to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
