INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Takhzyro, a human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, is indicated
for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients
≥ 2 years of age.1
Guidelines
According to US HAE Association Medical Advisory Board Guidelines (2020), when
HAE is suspected based on clinical presentation, appropriate testing includes
measurement of the serum C4 level, C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) antigenic level,
and C1-INH functional level.2 Low C4 plus low C1-INH antigenic or functional level is
consistent with a diagnosis of HAE types I/II. The decision on when to use long-term
prophylaxis cannot be made on rigid criteria but should reflect the needs of the
individual patient. First-line medications for HAE I/II include intravenous C1-INH,
Haegarda® (C1-INH [human] subcutaneous injection), or Takhzyro. The guideline
was written prior to approval of Orladeyo® (berotralstat capsules).
According to World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology guidelines (2021), it is recommended to evaluate for long-term
prophylaxis at every visit, taking disease activity, burden, and control as well as

Policy
patient preference into consideration.3 The following therapies are supported as first-
line options for long-term prophylaxis: plasma-derived C1-INH (87% agreement),
Takhzyro (89% agreement), and Orladeyo (81% agreement). With regard to
plasma-derived C1-INH, it is noted that Haegarda provided very good and dose-
dependent preventative effects on the occurrence of HAE attacks; the subcutaneous
route may provide more convenient administration and maintain improved steady-
state plasma concentrations compared with the intravenous route. Of note,
androgens are not recommended in the first-line setting for long-term prophylaxis.
Recommendations are not made regarding long-term prophylaxis in HAE with normal
C1-INH.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Takhzyro. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Takhzyro as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Takhzyro to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated. A patient who has previously met initial therapy criteria for
Takhzyro for the requested indication under the Coverage Review Department and is
currently receiving the requested therapy is only required to meet the continuation
therapy criteria (i.e., currently receiving Takhzyro). If past criteria have not been met
under the Coverage Review Department and the patient is currently receiving
Takhzyro, initial therapy criteria must be met.
Documentation: Documentation will be required where noted in the criteria as
[documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not limited to,
chart notes, laboratory records, and prescription claims records.
• Takhzyro® (lanadelumab-flyo subcutaneous injection – Shire/Takeda)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Due to C1 Inhibitor (C1-INH) Deficiency –
Prophylaxis. Approve Takhzyro for 1 year if the patient meets ONE of the
following (A or B):
A) Initial therapy. Approve if the patient meets BOTH of the following (i and ii):
i. Patient has HAE type I or type II as confirmed by the following diagnostic
criteria (a and b):
Note: A diagnosis of HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE type III)
does NOT satisfy this requirement.
a) Patient has low levels of functional C1-INH protein (< 50% of normal)
at baseline, as defined by the laboratory reference values
[documentation required]; AND

Policy
b) Patient has lower than normal serum C4 levels at baseline, as defined
by the laboratory reference values [documentation required]; AND
ii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an
allergist/immunologist or a physician who specializes in the treatment of
HAE or related disorders.
B) Patient is currently receiving Takhzyro prophylaxis. Approve if the patient
meets ALL of the following (i, ii, and iii):
Note: If the patient is currently receiving the requested therapy, but has not
previously received approval of Takhzyro for this indication through the
Coverage Review Department, review under criteria for Initial Therapy.
i. Patient has a diagnosis of HAE type I or type II [documentation
required]; AND
Note: A diagnosis of HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE type III)
does NOT satisfy this requirement.
ii. According to the prescriber, the patient has had a favorable clinical
response since initiating Takhzyro prophylactic therapy compared with
baseline (i.e., prior to initiating prophylactic therapy); AND
Note: Examples of a favorable clinical response include decrease in HAE
acute attack frequency, decrease in HAE attack severity, or decrease in
duration of HAE attacks.
iii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an
allergist/immunologist or a physician who specializes in the treatment of
HAE or related disorders.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Takhzyro® (lanadelumab-flyo subcutaneous injection – Shire/Takeda)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concomitant Use with Other Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Prophylactic
Therapies. Takhzyro has not been studied in combination with other prophylactic
therapies for HAE, and combination therapy for long-term prophylactic use is not
recommended. Patients may use other medications, including Cinryze® (C1
esterase inhibitor [human] intravenous infusion), for on-demand treatment of
acute HAE attacks, and for short-term (procedural) prophylaxis.
Note: Examples of other HAE prophylactic therapies include Cinryze (C1 esterase
inhibitor [human] intravenous infusion), Haegarda (C1 esterase inhibitor [human]
subcutaneous injection), and Orladeyo (berotralstat capsules).
