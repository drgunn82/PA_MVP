REVIEW DATE: 06/04/2025; selected revision 07/16/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Siliq, an interleukin (IL)-17A antagonist, is indicated for treatment moderate to
severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or
phototherapy and who have failed to respond or have lost response to other
systemic therapies.1 In the pivotal trial, patients were assessed for a response at
Week 12.
Guidelines
Joint guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology and National Psoriasis
Medical Board (2019) have been published for management of psoriasis with
biologics.2 These guidelines list Siliq as a monotherapy treatment option for
patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Guidelines from the European
Dermatology Forum (2025) recommend biologics (including Siliq) as second-line
therapy for most patients requiring systemic treatment when there is inadequate

Policy
response, contraindication, or intolerance to conventional systemic agents (e.g.,
methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin).3
Safety
Siliq has a Boxed Warning, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)
program, and limited distribution program due to risks of suicidal ideation and
behavior. The REMS program requires prescribers and pharmacies to be certified to
prescribe and/or dispense Siliq.4 Patients must sign a patient-prescriber agreement
form and be aware of the need to seek medical attention for any new/worsening
suicidal thoughts or behavior, depression, anxiety, or mood changes.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Siliq. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Siliq as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Siliq to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes
in the condition being treated.
• Siliq® (brodalumab subcutaneous injection – Valeant)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Plaque Psoriasis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of
the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 3 months if the patient meets ALL of the
following (i, ii, iii, iv, v, and vi):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):
a) Patient has tried at least one traditional systemic agent for psoriasis
for at least 3 months, unless intolerant; OR
Note: Examples include methotrexate, cyclosporine, or acitretin. A 3-
month trial of psoralen plus ultraviolet A light (PUVA) also counts. An
exception to the requirement for a trial of one traditional systemic
agent for psoriasis can be made if the patient has already had a 3-
month trial or previous intolerance to at least one biologic other than
the requested drug. A biosimilar of the requested biologic does not
count. Refer to Appendix for examples of biologics used for plaque
psoriasis. A patient who has already tried a biologic for psoriasis is not
required to “step back” and try a traditional systemic agent for
psoriasis.

Policy
b) Patient has a contraindication to methotrexate, as determined by the
prescriber; AND
iii. According to the prescriber, the patient has been evaluated for risks of
suicidal ideation or behavior versus benefits of therapy; AND
iv. According to the prescriber, the patient does not have moderately severe
to severe depression; AND
v. According to the prescriber, within the past 5 years, the patient does not
have a history of suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior; AND
vi. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a dermatologist;
OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Siliq. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
ALL of the following (i, ii, iii, iv, v, and vi):
i. Patient has been established on therapy for at least 3 months; AND
Note: A patient who has received < 3 months of therapy or who is
restarting therapy is reviewed under criterion A (Initial Therapy).
ii. According to the prescriber, the patient has been evaluated for risks of
suicidal ideation or behavior versus benefits of therapy; AND
iii. According to the prescriber, the patient does not have moderately severe
to severe depression; AND
iv. According to the prescriber, the patient does not have suicidal ideation or
suicidal behavior; AND
v. Patient experienced a beneficial clinical response, defined as improvement
from baseline (prior to initiating Siliq) in at least one of the following:
estimated body surface area, erythema, induration/thickness, and/or
scale of areas affected by psoriasis; AND
vi. Compared with baseline (prior to receiving Siliq), patient experienced an
improvement in at least one symptom, such as decreased pain, itching,
and/or burning.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Siliq® (brodalumab subcutaneous injection – Valeant)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination
with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used
for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination
therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of
adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic disease-
modifying antirheumatic drug(s) [DMARDs] {e.g., methotrexate, leflunomide,
hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine} in combination with this medication.

Policy
2. Crohn’s Disease. Siliq is contraindicated in patients with Crohn’s disease.1
There is a published Phase II study evaluating Siliq in Crohn’s disease (n = 130)
that was terminated early due to a disproportionate number of worsening
Crohn’s disease and lack of efficacy.5
3. Rheumatoid Arthritis. Efficacy has not been established. A published Phase II
study (n = 252) did not demonstrate improvement in American College of
Rheumatology 20/50/70 responses with Siliq vs. placebo for treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis in patients who had previously failed methotrexate.6
