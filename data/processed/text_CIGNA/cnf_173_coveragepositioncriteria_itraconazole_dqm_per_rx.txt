INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Sporanox capsules (generic) and oral solution (generic) and Tolsura capsules all
contain itraconazole, an azole antifungal.1-3
Itraconazole capsules (Sporanox, generic) and Tolsura, are indicated for the
treatment of the following fungal infections in immunocompromised and non-
immunocompromised patients1,2:
• Pulmonary and extrapulmonary blastomycosis;
• Histoplasmosis, including chronic cavitary pulmonary disease and
disseminated, nonmeningeal histoplasmosis;
• Pulmonary and extrapulmonary aspergillosis, in patients who are intolerant
of or who are refractory to amphotericin B therapy.
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Antifungals – Itraconazole Drug Quantity Management
Policy – Per Rx
In addition, itraconazole capsules (Sporanox, generic) are indicated for the
treatment of the following fungal infections in non-immunocompromised patients1:
• Onychomycosis of the toenail, with or without fingernail involvement, due
to dermatophytes (tinea unguium);
• Onychomycosis of the fingernail due to dermatophytes (tinea unguium).
Itraconazole oral solution (Sporanox, generic) is indicated for the treatment of
oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis.3
Dosing
Itraconazole capsules (Sporanox, generic)
For the treatment of blastomycosis or histoplasmosis, the recommended dose is
200 mg once daily (QD).1 If there is no obvious improvement, or if there is
evidence of progressive fungal disease, the dose should be increased in 100 mg
increments to a maximum of 400 mg/day. Doses above 200 mg/day should be
given in two divided doses. For the treatment of aspergillosis, the dose is 200 to
400 mg/day. In life-threatening situations, a loading dose of 200 mg three times
daily (TID) [600 mg/day] for the first 3 days of treatment is recommended.
Treatment should be continued for a minimum of 3 months and until clinical
parameters and laboratory test indicate that the active fungal infection has
subsided; inadequate treatment may lead to recurrence of the active infection.
Doses up to 200 mg TID are recommended in guidelines.4-6
According to the prescribing information, for the treatment of toenail
onychomycosis with or without fingernail involvement, the recommended dose is
200 mg QD for 12 weeks.1 For the treatment of fingernail-only onychomycosis, the
recommended dose is two treatment-pulses, each consisting of 200 mg twice daily
(BID) [400 mg/day] for 1 week. Pulses are separated by a 3-week period without
itraconazole; therefore, two treatment-pulses occur over a 2-month period.
Continuous dosing of itraconazole 200 mg QD for 6 (fingernail) to 12 weeks
(toenail) have also been described.7
Itraconazole oral solution (Sporanox, generic)
For the treatment of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis, the solution should
be vigorously swished in the mouth (10 mL at a time) and swallowed.2
The recommended dose for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg
(20 mL) daily for 1 to 2 weeks.2 Generally, signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal
candidiasis resolve within several days. For patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis
unresponsive/refractory to treatment with fluconazole tablets, the recommended
dose is 100 mg (10 mL) BID. For patients responding to therapy, clinical response
will be seen in 2 to 4 weeks. Patients may be expected to relapse shortly after
discontinuing therapy. Limited data on the safety of long-term use (> 6 months) of
itraconazole oral solution are available.
For the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, the recommended dose is 100 mg (10
mL) daily for a minimum of 3 weeks.2 Treatment should continue for 2 weeks
6 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Antifungals – Itraconazole Drug Quantity Management
Policy – Per Rx
following resolution of symptoms. Doses up to 200 mg (20 mL) per day may be
used based on the patient’s response and medical judgment.
Itraconazole oral solution (Sporanox, generic) and itraconazole capsules (Sporanox,
generic) should not be used interchangeably.2
Tolsura capsules
The dose of Tolsura is 130 mg to 260 mg/day for the treatment of blastomycosis,
histoplasmosis, and aspergillosis.3 Tolsura is not approved for the treatment of
onychomycosis. For the treatment of blastomycosis and histoplasmosis, the
recommended dose is 130 mg QD; if there is no obvious improvement, or there is
evidence of progressive fungal disease, the dose should be increased in 65 mg
increments to a maximum of 260 mg/day (130 mg BID). For the treatment of
aspergillosis, the recommended dose is 130 mg QD or 260 mg BID. For all three
approved indications, in life-threatening situations, a loading dose of 130 mg TID
(390 mg/day) is recommended to be given for the first 3 days, followed by the
appropriate recommended dosing based on indication. Treatment should be
continued for a minimum of 3 months and until clinical parameters and laboratory
tests indicate that the active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of
treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection.
Availability
Itraconazole capsules (Sporanox, generic) are available as 100 mg capsules and
itraconazole oral solution (Sporanox, generic) is available as a 10 mg/mL oral
solution in 150 mL bottles.1,2 Tolsura is available as a 65 mg capsule.3
