INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Inpefa, a sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, is indicated to reduce
the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF),
and urgent heart failure visit in adults with1:
• Heart failure; OR
• Type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and other CV risk
factors.
Unlike other SGLT-2 inhibitors, Inpefa is not indicated for glycemic control.
Guidelines
The pivotal data with Inpefa are mentioned in many available guidelines. SGLT-2
inhibitors are recommended as first-line treatment for heart failure in the American
Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure Society of
America joint guideline for the management of heart failure (2022).2 The pivotal trial
with Inpefa in patients with heart failure is noted to extend the benefits of SGLT-2
inhibitors to patients with diabetes and acutely decompensated heart failure.5
A 2023 ACC expert consensus statement notes the benefit of SGLT-2 inhibitors as
part of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with heart failure with

preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).8 According to the ACC expert consensus
statement, SGLT-2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, Jardiance™ [empagliflozin tablets])
should be initiated in all individuals with HFpEF who are stable during hospitalization
and have no contraindications. The pivotal heart failure trial with Inpefa is
mentioned, and it is noted that Inpefa treatment resulted in a significantly lower total
number of deaths from CV causes, HHF, and urgent visits for heart failure than
placebo, regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction.
A 2023 focused update of the 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the
diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic heart failure recommends an SGLT-2
inhibitor (dapagliflozin, Jardiance) in patients with symptomatic heart failure with
moderately-reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or HFpEF to reduce the risk of HHF
or CV death (Class I, Level A).10 In patients hospitalized for acute heart failure, an
intensive strategy of initiation and rapid up-titration of evidence-based treatment
(including, but not limited to dapagliflozin or Jardiance) before discharge and during
frequent and careful follow-up visits in the first 6 weeks following HHF is
recommended to reduce the risk of HHF or death (Class I, Level B). In patients with
type 2 diabetes and CKD, SGLT-2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin or Jardiance) are
recommended to reduce the risk of HHF or CV death (Class I, Level A).
The 2024 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction (HFrEF) recommends SGLT inhibitors (dapagliflozin, Inpefa, and
Jardiance) as a core therapy in the “four pillars” of medical care for HFrEF.11
The Kidney Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline
for diabetes management in CKD (2022) and the American Diabetes Association
(ADA)/KDIGO diabetes management in CKD consensus report (2022) recommend an
SGLT-2 with proven kidney or CV benefit for patients with type 2 diabetes, CKD, and
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2.4,6 SGLT-2
inhibitors are recommended independent of hemoglobin A (HbA ) or the need for
1c 1c
additional glucose lowering. This recommendation is based on strong evidence that
SGLT-2 inhibitors reduce CKD progression, heart failure, and atherosclerotic CV
disease (ASCVD) risk in patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD. Results from pivotal
trials with Inpefa are briefly mentioned.
The ADA standards of care (2024) recommend an SGLT-2 inhibitor or glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist with demonstrated CV disease benefit as part of the
glucose lowering regimen and comprehensive CV risk reduction strategy,
independent of HbA in patients with established CV disease or indicators of high CV
1c
risk, established kidney disease, or heart failure.3 The data with Inpefa from its
pivotal trials (SCORED and SOLOIST-WHF) are mentioned and it is noted that both
trials were terminated early due to a loss of funding. Of note, the standards state
that the early termination of SOLOIST-WHF limited the ability to determine the effects
of Inpefa in HFpEF specifically. An ADA and European Association for the Study of
Diabetes consensus statement on the management of type 2 diabetes (2022) is
reflected in the ADA standards of care.9

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) comprehensive type 2
diabetes management algorithm (2023) builds on the 2022 AACE diabetes clinical
practice guideline.5,7 SGLT-2 inhibitors with ‘proven benefit’ are an alternative to
GLP-1 agonists to reduce the risk of major adverse CV events or CV death in patients
with type 2 diabetes and established CV disease. For patients with type 2 diabetes
and established ASCVD or at high risk for ASCVD, the use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor
reduces the risk of HHF and in patients with heart failure and/or CKD, SGLT-2
inhibitors should be used as first-line therapy. SGLT-2 inhibitors are recommended
in patients with type 2 diabetes and heart failure regardless of glycemic goal or other
antihyperglycemic treatments. There are robust data for the benefit of SGLT-2
inhibitors to reduce adverse renal outcomes. Use of an SGLT-2 inhibitor with ‘proven
benefits’ is recommended as initial therapy to reduce the progression of diabetic
kidney disease and CV disease risk for patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic
kidney disease with eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 or ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 if heart
failure is also present.
