INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Palforzia, an oral immunotherapy, is indicated for the mitigation of allergic
reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to
peanut.1 It is approved for use in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut
allergy.
Initial dose escalation may be administered to patients 1 through 17 years of age;
up-dosing and maintenance may be continued in patients ≥ 1 year of age. Palforzia
is labeled to be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet. It is not indicated
for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Prior to
initiation, the prescriber should verify that the patient has injectable epinephrine and
has been instructed on its appropriate use. Palforzia is contraindicated in patients
with uncontrolled asthma and patients with a history of eosinophilic esophagitis and
other eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease.

Clinical Efficacy
The Palforzia pivotal study in patients 4 to 17 years of age, PALISADE, included
patients who were required to have a diagnosis of peanut allergy supported by either
a positive serum peanut-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) test or a positive skin prick
test for peanut.2 Additionally, to be eligible for randomization, patients had to have
an allergic reaction (with dose-limiting symptoms) to a prespecified dose of peanut
protein during a double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge at screening. One
of the key safety studies supporting the approval of Palforzia in patients 4 to 17 years
of age required patients to have peanut allergy characterized by allergic signs and
symptoms observed within 2 hours of known oral peanut exposure. In the Palforzia
pivotal study in patients 1 to 3 years of age, eligible patients had a documented
history of a physician-diagnosed IgE-mediated peanut allergy or no known history of
peanut ingestion and a peanut-specific IgE level indicative of peanut allergy within
12 months prior to randomization.3 The physician-diagnosis of peanut allergy was
required to include clinical signs and/or symptoms of allergy within 2 hours of peanut
exposure and either a positive skin prick test or aa psIgE level indicative of peanut
allergy within 12 months prior to randomization.4
Guidelines
Current guidelines regarding diagnosis and management of food allergy state that
parent and patient reports of food allergy must be confirmed.3,5 A skin prick test and
allergen-specific IgE testing are each recommended as a method to identify foods
that provoke allergic reactions. In children and adolescents with a confirmed IgE-
mediated peanut allergy, peanut oral immunotherapy (e.g., Palforzia) is
recommended to achieve desensitization (high certainty of evidence; strong
recommendation).6
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Palforzia. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Palforzia as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Palforzia to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
