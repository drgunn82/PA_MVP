REVIEW DATE: 02/05/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Bronchitol, a sugar alcohol, is indicated as add-on maintenance therapy to improve
pulmonary function in patients ≥ 18 years of age with cystic fibrosis (CF).1
Safety
Bronchitol can cause bronchospasm, which can be severe in susceptible patients.1
Therefore, Bronchitol is contraindicated in individuals who fail to pass the Bronchitol
Tolerance Test. Prior to prescribing Bronchitol, the Bronchitol Tolerance Test must be
administered and performed under the supervision of a healthcare practitioner who is able
to manage acute bronchospasm, to identify patients who are suitable candidates for
Bronchitol maintenance therapy. For patients who have passed the Bronchitol Tolerance
Test, the recommended dosage of Bronchitol is 400 mg twice a day by oral inhalation (the
contents of 10 capsules administered individually) via the inhaler. A short-acting
bronchodilator should be administered by oral inhalation, 5 to 15 minutes before every dose
of Bronchitol. Bronchitol should be taken once in the morning and once in the evening, with
the later dose taken at least 2 to 3 hours before bedtime.
Guidelines
Bronchitol is not addressed in US guidelines for CF. Guidelines from the CF Foundation
(2013) in the US strongly recommend chronic use of Pulmozyme® (dornase alfa inhalation
solution) in patients ≥ 6 years of age with moderate to severe disease to improve lung
function and quality of life and reduce exacerbations. Pulmozyme is also recommended for
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Cystic Fibrosis – Bronchitol Prior Authorization Policy
chronic use in patients ≥ 6 years of age with asymptomatic or mild disease to improve lung
function and reduce exacerbations. Chronic use of hypertonic saline is also recommended in
individuals with CF who are ≥ 6 years of age to improve lung function and quality of life and
reduce exacerbations. Standards for the care of patients with CF from the European CF
Society (2024) recognize inhaled dry powder mannitol as an alternative to hypertonic saline
in patients with CF; however, both agents are noted to irritate the airways and therefore
initial tolerance testing is recommended often with the use of premedication with
bronchodilators.6
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Bronchitol. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Bronchitol as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires Bronchitol
to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
