CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the GLP-1/glucose-
dependent insulinotropic polypeptide-1 (GIP) agonist addressed in this policy are
indicated as adjuncts to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with
type 2 diabetes.1-8 Liraglutide, Trulicity, and Bydureon BCise are additionally
Page 1 of 9 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Diabetes – Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Agonists Prior
Authorization Policy
indicated for type 2 diabetes in patients ≥ 10 years of age.3,7,8 Liraglutide, Ozempic,
and Trulicity also have labeled indications related to cardiovascular (CV) risk
reduction in adults with type 2 diabetes.5,7,8 Additionally, Ozempic is indicated to
reduce the risk of sustained estimated glomerular filtration decline, end-stage kidney
disease, and CV death in adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease
(CKD).5
Guidelines
According to the American Diabetes Association Standards of Care (2025),
pharmacologic therapy be guided by person-centric treatment factors including
comorbid conditions, as well as treatment goals, and preferences.9 Pharmacotherapy
should be initiated at the time type 2 diabetes is diagnosed unless there are
contraindications.
In adults with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD),
heart failure (HF), and/or CKD, treatment should include agents that reduce CV or
kidney disease risk.9 In individuals without ASCVD, HF, or CKD, the choice of therapy
should be based on considerations of weight management, mitigation of metabolic-
dysfunction associated liver disease (MASLD) or metabolic-dysfunction associated
steatohepatitis (MASH) risk, and achievement and maintenance of individualized
glycemic goals. In general, higher-efficacy approaches, including combination
therapy, have a greater likelihood of achieving treatment goals. Weight management
is a distinct treatment goal, along with glycemic management, as it has multifaceted
benefits, including reduction of HbA , reduction in hepatic steatosis, and
1c
improvement in CV risk factors.
GLP-1 agonists are broadly recognized not only for their glycemic effects but for other
beneficial effects in patients with type 2 diabetes.9 Among patients with type 2
diabetes with established ASCVD or indicators of high ASCVD risk, GLP-1 agonists
with proven CV benefit (i.e., labeled indication of reducing CV disease events) or a
sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor are preferred regardless of
baseline metformin use.9 In individuals with type 2 diabetes with HF with preserved
ejection fraction and obesity, a GLP-1 agonist with demonstrated benefits for both
glycemic management and reduction of HF-related symptoms, irrespective of HbA
1c
is recommended (data are currently available with semaglutide [Wegovy®
{semaglutide SC injection}] and tirzepatide [e.g., Mounjaro and Zepbound®
{tirzepatide SC injection}]). In adults with type 2 diabetes and advanced CKD
(estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min), a GLP-1 agonist is preferred for
glycemic management due to lower risk of hypoglycemia and for CV event reduction.
Ozempic has a beneficial effect on ASCVD, mortality, and kidney outcomes among
individuals with CKD, and therefore is a recommended first-line agent for individuals
with CKD. Other GLP-1 agonists and Mounjaro may have CKD benefits, however, no
dedicated kidney trials have been published.
In patients without cardiorenal risk factors described above, the GLP-1 agonists are
additionally recommended in patients based on glycemic needs.9 Metformin or other
agents that provide adequate efficacy to achieve and maintain glycemic treatment
goals are recommended. In general, higher efficacy approaches have a greater
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Diabetes – Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Agonists Prior
Authorization Policy
likelihood of achieving glycemic goals. The GLP-1 agonists, Ozempic and Trulicity
[high dose] and the GLP-1/GIP agonist, Mounjaro, are among the agents considered
to have “very high” efficacy for glucose lowering; the other GLP-1 agonists are
considered to have “high” efficacy for glucose lowering.
Many individuals with diabetes with obesity are at high risk for developing MASLD or
MASH as well as MASH cirrhosis.9 In adults with type 2 diabetes, MASLD, and
overweight or obesity, a GLP-1 agonist (i.e., liraglutide, semaglutide) or GLP-1/GIP
agonist (i.e., tirzepatide) with potential benefits in MASH for glycemic management,
in addition to healthy interventions for weight loss, is recommended. In adults with
type 2 diabetes and MASH or those at high risk for liver fibrosis (based on non-
invasive tests), pioglitazone, GLP-1 agonists, or a GLP-1/GIP agonist is preferred for
glycemic management due to potential beneficial effects on MASH.
Weight management is also a treatment goal in individuals with type 2 diabetes due
to multiple benefits including improved glycemic control, reduction in hepatic
steatosis, and improvement in CV risk factors.9 The choice of therapy for glycemic
control should support weight management goals in those with obesity; Mounjaro
and Ozempic are noted to have the highest efficacy in terms of glucose lowering and
weight loss, followed by Trulicity, liraglutide, and Bydureon BCise. Additional weight
management approaches, alone or in combination, should be used if needed to
achieve an individual’s weight loss goals (i.e., intensive behavioral therapy, weight
loss pharmacotherapy, or metabolic surgery).
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists statement on the comprehensive
care for type 2 diabetes (2023) provides principles for the management of type 2
diabetes.12 In patients with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD or at high risk
for ASCVD, GLP-1 agonists and SGLT-2 inhibitors are recommended. In a patient
with type 2 diabetes and established ASCVD or are at high risk, a GLP-1 agonist with
proven CV benefit (liraglutide, Ozempic, Trulicity) should be initiated as a first-line
therapy independent of the glycemic goal or other antihyperglycemic treatments,
including metformin; SGLT-2 inhibitors are an alternative. In patients with type 2
diabetes and ASCVD or at high risk of ASCVD, use of a GLP-1 agonist is also
recommended to reduce the risk of stroke. To reduce the risk of progression of
diabetic kidney disease and CV disease in patients with type 2 diabetes, SGLT-2
inhibitors are recommended; GLP-1 agonists are also an option to reduce progression
of albuminuria, renal function decline, and ASCVD risk in individuals with type 2
diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (Ozempic and Trulicity are cited). For patients
with type 2 diabetes but without established or high risk for ASCVD, heart failure,
stroke, or CKD, metformin should be the initial therapy unless contraindicated. In
patients who are overweight or obese, the following therapies are recommended and
listed in order of preference: Mounjaro, GLP-1 agonists, and SGLT-2 inhibitors. In
patients with a history of hypoglycemia, at high risk of hypoglycemia, or at risk of
severe complications from hypoglycemia, recommended therapies (in order of
preference) are: GLP-1 agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors, Mounjaro, thiazolidinediones,
and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors.
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Diabetes – Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Agonists Prior
Authorization Policy
Kidney Diseases Improving Global Outcomes 2024 guidelines for the clinical
evaluation and management of CKD recommend a long-acting GLP-1 agonist
(prioritizing agents with documented CV benefits) in adults with type 2 diabetes and
CKD who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin
and an SGLT-2 inhibitors, or who are unable to take those medications.13
A report of the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association
(2024) recommends GLP-1 agonists (liraglutide, Ozempic) and SGLT-2 inhibitors to
reduce the risk of major adverse CV events in adults with type 2 diabetes and
peripheral arterial disease.14

is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
Coverage is not recommended in the following situations:
1. Weight Loss Treatment. Saxenda (liraglutide subcutaneous injection) contains
the same chemical entity as liraglutide (Victoza, generic) and is indicated at a
higher dose for chronic weight management. Wegovy (semaglutide subcutaneous
injection) contains the same chemical entity as Ozempic and is indicated at a
higher dose for chronic weight management. Zepbound (tirzepatide
subcutaneous injection) contains the same chemical entity as Mounjaro and is
indicated at the same doses for chronic weight management. Endocrine Society
guidelines for pharmacological management of obesity (2015) advise against off-
label prescribing of medications such as GLP-1 receptor agonists for the sole
purpose of producing weight loss.10 The American Gastroenterology Association
guidelines for pharmacological interventions for adults with obesity only provide
recommendations for the GLP-1 agonists approved for weight loss (i.e., Saxenda
and Wegovy).11 The GLP-1 agonists and GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic

polypeptide-1 agonist in this policy are not FDA-approved for weight loss in a
patient who is overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 27 kg/m2) or obese (BMI ≥
30 kg/m2) without type 2 diabetes.
Note: If the patient has type 2 diabetes, refer to FDA-Approved Indication.
2. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. None of the GLP-1 agonists or GLP-1/ glucose-
dependent insulinotropic polypeptide-1 agonist are indicated for patients with type
1 diabetes.1-8 Addition of GLP-1 receptor agonists to insulin therapy resulted in
small (0.2%) reductions in hemoglobin A among patients with type 1 diabetes
1c
compared with insulin alone.9
3. Prediabetes/Diabetes Prevention. GLP-1 agonists and the GLP-1/ glucose-
dependent insulinotropic polypeptide agonist are not indicated in a patient with
elevated blood glucose who does not have type 2 diabetes. The American
Diabetes Association Standards of Care (2025) recommend consideration of
metformin for the prevention of type 2 diabetes in adults at high risk of type 2
diabetes, and in individuals with prior gestational diabetes mellitus. First-line
recommendations to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes are lifestyle and behavioral
modification (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, sleep).9 Further, metformin has the
longest history of safety data as a pharmacologic therapy for diabetes prevention.
Note: If the patient has type 2 diabetes, refer to FDA-Approved Indication.
4. Metabolic Syndrome. The GLP-1 agonists and the GLP-1/glucose-dependent
insulinotropic polypeptide-1 agonist are not indicated in a patient with metabolic
syndrome who does not have type 2 diabetes.
Note: If the patient has type 2 diabetes, refer to FDA-Approved Indication.
5. Concomitant Use with Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Agonists or GLP-
1/ Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide (GIP) Agonist. The
GLP-1 agonists and the GLP-1/GIP agonist should not be combined with each other
or with any other GLP-1 agonists or GLP-1/GIP agonist. There are other GLP-1
and GLP-1/GIP products not included in this policy that are FDA-approved for
weight loss and are not indicated for type 2 diabetes.
Note: Examples of other GLP-1 agonists not included in this policy include but
are not limited to Saxenda (liraglutide subcutaneous injection) and Wegovy
(semaglutide subcutaneous injection). An example of a GLP-1/GIP agonist not
included in this policy is Zepbound (tirzepatide subcutaneous injection).
