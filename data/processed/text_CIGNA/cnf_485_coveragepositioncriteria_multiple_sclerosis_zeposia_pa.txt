INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE

BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Zeposia, a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, is indicated for the following
uses:1
• Relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), in adults, including clinically
isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting disease, and active secondary
progressive disease.
• Ulcerative colitis (UC), in adults with moderately to severely active disease.
Guidelines/Clinical Efficacy
Published guidelines address recommended treatments for the following conditions:
• Multiple sclerosis (MS): Zeposia is not currently addressed in MS guidelines.
In September 2019, a consensus paper was updated by the MS Coalition that
discusses the use of disease-modifying therapies in MS.2 Many options from
Page 1 of 9 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Multiple Sclerosis and Ulcerative Colitis (Oral –
Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor Modulator) – Zeposia Prior Authorization Policy
various pharmacologic classes, involving different mechanisms of action and
modes of administration, have shown benefits in patients with MS.
• Ulcerative colitis (UC): Zeposia is not currently addressed in UC guidelines.
The American Gastroenterological Association (2020) and the American
College of Gastroenterology (2019) have clinical practice guidelines on the
management of moderate to severe UC and make recommendations for
induction and maintenance of remission in adults.3,4 Both organizations
endorse the use of biologic agents and give specific patient circumstances in
the selection for induction and maintenance therapies. The 10-week induction
pivotal trial for Zeposia included adults with moderately to severely active UC
who had an inadequate response or were intolerant to any of the following
agents: oral aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators (e.g., 6-
mercaptopurine and azathioprine), or a biologic (e.g., tumor necrosis factor
inhibitor, Entyvio® [vedolizumab intravenous infusion and subcutaneous
injection]).1
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Zeposia. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Zeposia as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Zeposia to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Zeposia® (ozanimod capsules – Celgene)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence

2. Ulcerative Colitis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of
the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets ALL of the following
(i and ii):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist;
OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Zeposia. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
BOTH of the following (i and ii):
i. Patient has been established on therapy for at least 6 months; AND
Note: A patient who has received < 6 months of therapy or who is
restarting therapy is reviewed under criterion A (Initial Therapy).
ii. Patient meets at least ONE of the following (a or b):
a) When assessed by at least one objective measure, patient experienced
a beneficial clinical response from baseline (prior to initiating the
requested drug); OR
Note: Examples of assessment for inflammatory response include fecal
markers (e.g., fecal calprotectin), serum markers (e.g., C-reactive
protein), endoscopic assessment, and/or reduced dose of
corticosteroids.
b) Compared with baseline (prior to initiating the requested drug), patient

5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Multiple Sclerosis and Ulcerative Colitis (Oral –
Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Receptor Modulator) – Zeposia Prior Authorization Policy
decreased pain, fatigue, stool frequency, and/or decreased rectal
bleeding.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Zeposia® (ozanimod capsules – Celgene)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with Other Disease-Modifying Agents Used for Multiple
Sclerosis. These agents are not indicated for use in combination (see Appendix
B for examples). Additional data are required to determine if use of disease-
modifying multiple sclerosis agents in combination is safe and provides added
efficacy.
2. Non-Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis. The efficacy of Zeposia has not
been established in patients with multiple sclerosis with non-relapsing forms of
the disease.1
Note: An example of a non-relapsing form of multiple sclerosis is primary
progressive multiple sclerosis.
3. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix A for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
4. Concurrent Use with Other Potent Immunosuppressants. In pivotal trials,
patients who received Zeposia were not to receive concomitant treatment with
non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive or immune-modulating therapies used for
the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Combination therapy is generally not
recommended due to a potential for a higher rate of adverse effects with
combinations and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.1
Note: Examples of non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive or immune-modulating
therapies include 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and
methotrexate.
