CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Mavyret, a direct-acting antiviral, contains glecaprevir, a pangenotypic NS3/4A
protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a pangenotypic NS5A inhibitor.1 It is indicated
for the treatment of acute and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the following
scenarios:
• Patients ≥ 3 years of age with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection without
cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A).
• Patients ≥ 3 years of age with genotype 1 infection who have previously
been treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A
protease inhibitor, but not both.
Dosing
Page 1 of 10 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Hepatitis C – Mavyret Prior Authorization for Preferred
Specialty Management Policy
The duration of therapy is based on prior treatment experience, genotype, and the
presence or absence of cirrhosis (see Tables 1 and 2). In addition, Mavyret is
recommended for 12 weeks in patients ≥ 3 years of age who are liver or kidney
transplant recipients. Similar to non-transplant recipients, a 16-week treatment
duration is recommended in genotype 1-infected patients who are NS5A inhibitor-
experienced without prior treatment with an NS3/4A protease inhibitor or in
genotype 3-infected patients who are treatment-experienced with regimens
containing interferon, pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and/or Sovaldi® (sofosbuvir
tablets/oral pellets). The clinical trial in patients with acute HCV assessed Mavyret
for 8 weeks.

containing Olysio® (simeprevir capsules) and Sovaldi, or Olysio, Victrelis® (boceprevir capsules), or
Incivek® (telaprevir tablets) with interferon or pegylated interferon and ribavirin were studied; 2
Regimens containing ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or Daklinza® (daclatasvir tablets) + pegylated interferon +
ribavirin [unapproved regimen] were studied.
Efficacy in Acute HCV
The efficacy of Mavyret in patients with acute HCV was evaluated in a single-arm,
open-label study in adults who were treatment-naïve for their current infection (n =
286).1 All patients received Mavyret for 8 weeks. Eligible patients had a diagnosis
of acute HCV infection at screening defined as physician diagnosis, quantifiable HCV
RNA, and one or more of the following: Recent conversion of negative to positive
results in anti-HCV antibody, HCV RNA, or HCV core antigen testing; liver disease
signs associated with acute HCV infection1; and recent risk behaviors for HCV
infection1 within the past 6 months4. In addition, patients either had compensated
cirrhosis or did not have cirrhosis.4 Among the enrolled patients, 84% had
evidence of clinical hepatitis at screening in the absence of other causes of liver
disease and with recent risk behavior for HCV transmission.1 At baseline 96% of
patients had quantifiable HCV RNA; 39% of these patients had a documented result
of negative HCV antibody or unquantifiable HCV RNA within the prior 1 year, and
10 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Hepatitis C – Mavyret Prior Authorization for Preferred Specialty
Management Policy
4% of whom had unquantifiable HCV RNA (potentially reflecting spontaneous
clearance of the HCV infection during the pretreatment period). A prior history of
HCV infection was reported in 18% of patients; 2% of patients had cirrhosis. Most
patients had genotype 1 HCV (58%); 4% of patients had genotype 2, 12% had
genotype 3, and 17% had genotype 4. The overall rate of SVR12 was 96%; no
patient had virologic failure.
Guidelines
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases
Society of America (AASLD/IDSA) provide recommendations for testing, monitoring,
and treating HCV (December 19, 2023).2 The guidelines have not been updated
since the approval of Mavyret in acute HCV infection.
Patients with acute infection should be treated upon initial diagnosis (defined as
quantifiable HCV RNA) without awaiting spontaneous resolution.2 Owing to high
efficacy and safety, the same regimens that are recommended for chronic HCV
infection are recommended for acute infection. At the time the recommendation
was made, the guidelines note that there were insufficient evidence to support a
particular regimen or treatment duration outside of a clinical trial. Pangenotypic
regimens are recommended if HCV genotyping is not available or if a concern of
exposure to more than one genotype exists. Additionally, the guidelines state that
using the same regimens to treat acute or recent HCV as for chronic HCV also
simplifies management as defining acute HCV may be clinically challenging.
Instances in which the guidelines provide recommendations for Mavyret outside of
the FDA-approved indications are outlined below.
With the availability of pangenotypic HCV treatment regimens, HCV genotyping is
no longer required prior to treatment initiation for all individuals.2 Pretreatment
genotyping is still recommended in patients with cirrhosis and/or past unsuccessful
HCV treatment, because treatment regimens may differ by genotype. However, for
treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis, although genotyping may impact the
preferred treatment approach, it is not required if a pangenotypic regimen is used.
In treatment-naïve adults without cirrhosis, the recommended regimens are
Mavyret for 8 weeks or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks. Additional genotype-
specific and/or special circumstance-specific recommendations are also provided for
patients falling outside of these parameters. Mavyret is recognized as a
recommended regimen (12 weeks) for the treatment of patients with recurrent HCV
post-liver transplantation (without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis).
Treatment-naïve adults with compensated cirrhosis are also eligible for simplified
treatment. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, the recommended regimen in
patients with genotype 1 through 6 is Mavyret for 8 weeks; sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
for 12 weeks is recommended in patients with genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 (patients
with genotype 3 require baseline NS5A resistance-associated substitution testing.
Those without Y93H can be treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks).
Genotype testing is not required for Mavyret as part of the simplified algorithm in
patients with compensated cirrhosis.
10 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Hepatitis C – Mavyret Prior Authorization for Preferred Specialty
Management Policy
Mavyret is recognized as a recommended regimen (12 weeks) for the treatment of
patients with recurrent HCV post-liver transplantation (without cirrhosis or with
compensated cirrhosis).
The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition
recommendations on the treatment of hepatitis C (2024) describe the optimal
therapeutic management of adolescents and children with HCV infection.3 Direct-
acting antiviral regimens are recommended for all treatment-naïve and treatment-
experienced children ≥ 3 years of age with chronic HCV. When available, the
regimen of choice should be one that has the shortest treatment duration and does
not require concomitant ribavirin. In addition, to simplify treatment and avoid the
need of genotyping and/or baseline resistance‐associated substitutions assessment,
pangenotypic regimens are preferred. In children and adolescents without
cirrhosis, or with compensated cirrhosis, recommended regimens are Mavyret,
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. In children and adolescents with
decompensated cirrhosis, treatment should follow adult guidelines.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Mavyret.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Mavyret as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and efficacy, approval requires
Mavyret to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated.
