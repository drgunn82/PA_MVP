INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY

CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Methylergonovine, a semi-synthetic ergot alkaloid, is indicated for management of
uterine atony, hemorrhage, and subinvolution of the uterus following
delivery of the placenta; and for control of uterine hemorrhage in the second
stage of labor following delivery of the anterior shoulder.1
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
Methylergonovine can cause constriction of the smooth muscles in the blood vessels
and this effect can be helpful in treating vascular headaches, such as migraines or
cluster headaches.2 However, methylergonovine should only be used for limited
periods of time in most patients and only under careful supervision of a physician.
The dose of methylergonovine used for migraines is 0.2 to 0.4 mg three times a day;
a maximum dose of 1.6 mg/day has been reported (eight 0.2 mg tablets per day).
Guidelines/Recommendations
An updated assessment of the preventive and acute treatment of migraine by
the American Headache Society (AHS) [2018; update 2021] reaffirms previous
migraine guidelines.3,4 Methylergonovine is not addressed in the update.
Prevention. Patients with migraine should be considered for preventive treatment
in the following situations: when attacks significantly interfere with patients’ daily
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Methylergonovine Prior Authorization Policy
routines despite acute treatment; frequent attacks (≥ 4 monthly headache days);
contraindication to, failure, overuse, or adverse events with acute treatments; or
patient preference. Before developing a preventive treatment plan, the appropriate
use (e.g., drug type, route and timing of administration, frequency) of acute
treatments should be initiated and coupled with education and lifestyle modifications.
All patients with migraine should be offered a trial of acute treatment. Based on the
level of evidence for efficacy and the American Academy of Neurology scheme for
classification of evidence, the following oral treatments have established efficacy and
should be offered for migraine prevention: antiepileptic drugs (divalproex sodium,
valproate sodium, topiramate [not for women of childbearing potential without a
reliable method of birth control]); beta-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol, timolol);
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists indicated for migraine
prevention (i.e., Aimovig, Ajovy, Emgality, Nurtec ODT, Qulipta, and Vyepti); and
frovatriptan (for short-term preventive treatment of menstrual migraine). The
following treatments are probably effective and should be considered for migraine
prevention: antidepressants (amitriptyline, venlafaxine); beta-blockers (atenolol,
nadolol); and angiotensin receptor blockers (candesartan). Treatment. Triptans
(e.g., almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, and
zolmitriptan) are considered the gold standard for acute treatment of moderate to
severe migraine headaches or mild to moderate migraine headaches that respond
poorly to over-the-counter analgesics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) as a class are mentioned as an option for acute treatment of mild to
moderate migraine attacks; celecoxib is not specifically addressed. The potential for
cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events with NSAID use is noted. Other
treatment options in the mild to moderate setting include nonopioid analgesics,
acetaminophen, or caffeinated analgesic combinations. For moderate to severe
attacks or attacks which respond poorly to NSAIDs or caffeinated combinations, the
update lists the triptans, dihydroergotamine, the oral CGRP receptor antagonists
(Nurtec® ODT [rimegepant orally disintegrating tablets,] and Ubrelvy® [ubrogepant
tablets]), and Reyvow™ (lasmiditan tablet) as effective treatments. The
recommendation remains that clinicians must consider medication efficacy and
potential medication-related adverse events when prescribing acute medications for
migraine.
The AHS issued an update to their position statement (2024) specifically regarding
therapies targeting CGRP for the prevention of migraine.5 The evidence for the
efficacy, tolerability, and safety of CGRP-targeting migraine preventive therapies
(specifically, the monoclonal antibodies: Aimovig® [erenumab-aooe subcutaneous
{SC} injection], Ajovy® [fremanezumab-vfrm SC injection], Emgality®
[galcanezumab-gnlm SC injection], and Vyepti® [eptinezumab-jjmr intravenous
infusion], and the gepants: Nurtec ODT [rimegepant orally disintegrating tablets] and
Qulipta® [atogepant tablets]) is substantial and consistent across different individual
CGRP-targeting treatments. Extensive “real-world” clinical experience corroborates
clinical trials. This data indicates that the efficacy and tolerability of CGRP-targeting
therapies are equal to or greater than those of previous first-line therapies. The
CGRP-targeting therapies should be considered as a first-line approach for migraine
prevention along with previous first-line treatments without a requirement for prior
failure of other classes of migraine preventive treatment. Additionally, Botox®
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Methylergonovine Prior Authorization Policy
(onabotulinumtoxinA SC injection) is considered a first-line therapy for prevention of
chronic migraine.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of
methylergonovine, for prescriptions with quantities exceeding 28 tablets per 30 days.
Twenty-eight (28) tablets per month will be sufficient to treat uterine atony,
hemorrhage, and subinvolution of the uterus following the delivery of the placenta
(FDA-approved indication). All approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients with
migraines who are treated with methylergonovine as well as the monitoring required
for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires methylergonovine to be
prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
