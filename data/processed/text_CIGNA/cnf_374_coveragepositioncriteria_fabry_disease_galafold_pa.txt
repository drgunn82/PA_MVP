INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Galafold, an oral alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal) pharmacological chaperone, is
indicated for the treatment of Fabry disease in adults with an amenable
galactosidase alpha gene (GLA) variant based on in vitro assay data.1
Disease Overview
Fabry disease is a rare inherited X-linked lysosomal storage disorder.2-4 Absent or
significantly reduced α-Gal activity leads to the accumulation of
globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in a wide variety of cells throughout the body. The
accumulation of GL-3 leads to progressive multisystem disease, primarily impacting
the kidney, heart, and nervous system.3,4 Life expectancy in patients with Fabry
disease is reduced; median survival is typically 50 to 55 years in men and 70 years
in women.2
Currently, there have been more than 800 mutations to the gene encoding α-Gal
identified.5 About 60% are missense mutations resulting in single amino acid
substitutions. Some of these mutated enzymes have activity levels similar to normal
α-Gal; however, they have been found to be unstable and are retained in the
endoplasmic reticulum.

POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Galafold. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Galafold as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Galafold to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Galafold® (migalastat capsules – Amicus Therapeutics)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Fabry Disease. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of the following (A,
B, and C):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) Patient has an amenable galactosidase alpha gene (GLA) variant based on in
vitro assay data; AND
C) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a geneticist,
nephrologist, or a physician who specializes in the treatment of Fabry disease.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Galafold® (migalastat capsules – Amicus Therapeutics)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta intravenous infusion).
One small study (n = 23) assessed a single dose of Galafold (150 mg or 450 mg)
used concurrently with Fabrazyme or agalsidase alpha. While a single dose of
Galafold significantly increased α-Gal activity, the long-term safety and efficacy
of concurrent use of Galafold and Fabrazyme has not been established.6 Galafold
is not FDA approved for concurrent use with Fabrazyme.
2. Concurrent Use with Elfabrio (pegunigalsidase alfa intravenous infusion).
Galafold has not been evaluated for use in combination with Elfabrio. It is not FDA
approved for concurrent use with enzyme replacement therapy.
