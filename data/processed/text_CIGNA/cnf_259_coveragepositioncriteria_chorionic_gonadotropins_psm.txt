INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Pregnyl, Novarel, and chorionic gonadotropin for injection are indicated for the
following uses:1-3
• Prepubertal cryptorchidism not due to anatomical obstruction.
• Selected cases of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (hypogonadism
secondary to a pituitary deficiency) in males.
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Chorionic Gonadotropins Preferred Specialty
Management Policy
• Induction of ovulation and pregnancy in the anovulatory, infertile women
in whom the cause of anovulation is secondary and not due to primary
ovarian failure, and who has been appropriately pretreated with human
menotropins.
Ovidrel is indicated for the following uses:4
• Induction of final follicular maturation and early luteinization in
infertile women who have undergone pituitary desensitization and who have
been appropriately pretreated with follicle stimulating hormones as part of an
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) program such as in vitro fertilization
and embryo transfer.
• Induction of ovulation and pregnancy in anovulatory infertile patients in
whom the cause of infertility is functional and not due to primary ovarian
failure.
Pregnyl, Novarel, and chorionic gonadotropin for injection are highly purified
preparations obtained from the urine of pregnant females and are administered
intramuscularly.1-3 Ovidrel is a recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)
and is for subcutaneous use only.4 The physicochemical, immunological, and
biological activities of recombinant hCG are comparable to those of placental and
human pregnancy-urine derived hCG.
The action of hCG is very similar to the pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH), although
hCG possesses slight follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) activity.1-3 hCG also
stimulates production of gonadal steroid hormones by stimulating the interstitial
cells of the testis to produce androgens and the corpus luteum of the ovary to
produce progesterone.
In males, androgen stimulation by hCG results in the development of secondary sex
characteristics that may lead to testicular descent when no anatomical obstruction
is present.1-3 When hCG is discontinued, the descent is usually reversible. During
the normal menstrual cycle, LH acts with FSH in the maturation and development of
the normal ovarian follicle and the mid-cycle LH surge causes ovulation; hCG can
replace LH in this capacity. When pregnancy occurs, hCG produced by the placenta
maintains the corpus luteum after LH secretion decreases, supporting continued
secretion of estrogen and progesterone and preventing menstruation.

POLICY STATEMENT
Utilization of these products is not managed by a Prior Authorization Policy, but
rather based on whether a patient’s benefit includes infertility coverage. If the
patient’s benefit includes infertility coverage, this Preferred Specialty Management
Program has been developed to encourage the use of Preferred Products. The
program also directs the patient to try one Preferred Product prior to the approval
of a Non-Preferred Product. Requests for the Non-Preferred Products will also be
reviewed using the exception criteria (below). All approvals are provided for the
duration noted below.
If the patient’s benefit does not include infertility coverage, benefit exclusion
overrides may be in place. This Preferred Specialty Management program requires
the patient to meet standard Chorionic Gonadotropin Benefit Exclusion Overrides
Policy criteria and requires the patient to try a Preferred Product, when clinically
appropriate, prior to the approval of Non-Preferred Products.
If the patient’s benefit does not include infertility coverage and benefit exclusion
overrides are not utilized, coverage will be denied.
