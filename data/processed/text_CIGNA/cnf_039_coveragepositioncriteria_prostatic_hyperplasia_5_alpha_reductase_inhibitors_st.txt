DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
The 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and alpha -blockers are therapies in the treatment
1
of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).1 Finasteride and dutasteride
are both 5-alpha reductase inhibitors indicated to improve symptoms, reduce
the risk of acute urinary retention, and to reduce the need for BPH-related
surgery in men with enlarged prostates.2-4 Finasteride is also indicated to
decrease the risk of symptomatic progression of BPH in combination with
the alpha -blocker doxazosin.2 Dutasteride is also indicated for the treatment of
1
symptomatic BPH in men with an enlarged prostate in combination with
the alpha -blocker, tamsulosin.3,5 Jalyn is the commercially available product
1
which combines dutasteride and tamsulosin in one capsule for patients who require
dual therapy.5 The same dosage of dutasteride and tamsulosin can be obtained by
taking the respective products individually.
Guidelines
The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines on the management of lower
urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (2023)
recommends that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors can be used by men with

Inhibitors Step Therapy Policy
demonstrable prostatic enlargement.1 This class of medication does have a slow
onset of action and alpha-blocker would provide more immediate relief for men with
voiding symptoms. The 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors can be used with alpha-
blocker therapy. AUA does not recommend one 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor over
another.
