INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Dojolvi, a synthetic medium odd-chain triglyceride, is indicated as a source of calories
and fatty acids for the treatment molecularly confirmed long-chain fatty acid
oxidation disorders (LC-FAODs) in adults and pediatric patients.1
For a patient receiving another medium-chain triglyceride product, discontinue prior
to the first dose of Dojolvi.
Disease Overview
LC-FAODs are a group of autosomal recessive genetic metabolic disorders in which
the body is unable to properly oxidize long-chain fatty acid in the mitochondria
(normally an important energy pathway when glucose is low).2,3 The four most
commonly affected enzymes are carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2 (CPT-2), very long-

Authorization Policy
chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA
dehydrogenase (LCHAD), and mitochondrial trifunctional protein (TFP).4 Other less
common ones may also occur.2,4 Onset may occur anywhere from the neonatal period
to adulthood. Clinical manifestations are heterogeneous and not well correlated with
genotype.2 Diagnosis of LC-FAODs has increased with the use of routine newborn
screening. Newborn screening tests measure acylcarnitines in dried blood spots.5
Abnormal newborn screening results or the presence of symptoms associated with
LC-FAODs warrant further evaluation involving plasma acylcarnitine measurement,
enzyme activity assays, and/or genetic testing. The activity of specific enzymes can
be measured in lymphocytes or skin fibroblasts since these cells express all enzymes
involved in long-chain fatty acid oxidation.3 Genetic analysis can identify the specific
genetic defect. However, new pathogenic variants are regularly identified, requiring
functional studies such as enzyme activity measurements for confirmation of the
diagnosis.
Guidelines
A consensus statement regarding treatment recommendations in LC-FAODs was
published in 2009; Dojolvi is not specifically addressed, although medium-chain
triglycerides are discussed more broadly.6 In general, it is noted that the clinical
course of LC-FAODs is unpredictable, and medium-chain triglyceride supplementation
is an important part of the management strategy for many patients.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Dojolvi. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Dojolvi as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Dojolvi to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Dojolvi™ (triheptanoin oral liquid – Ultragenyx)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Long-Chain Fatty Acid Oxidation Disorders. Approve for 1 year if the patient
meets ALL of the following (A, B, C, and D):
A) Patient has a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of a long-chain fatty acid
oxidation disorder based on at least TWO of the following (i, ii, or iii):
i. Disease-specific elevations of acylcarnitines on a newborn blood spot or in
plasma; OR
ii. Enzyme activity assay (in cultured fibroblasts or lymphocytes) below the
lower limit of the normal reference range for the reporting laboratory; OR
Note: Examples of enzyme assays include carnitine palmitoyl transferase
2 (CPT-2), very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD), long-chain

3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD), and mitochondrial
trifunctional protein (TFP).
iii. Genetic testing demonstrating a pathogenic variant in a gene associated
with long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders; AND
Note: Examples of genes associated with long-chain fatty acid disorders
include CPT2 (encodes CPT-2), ACADVL (encodes VLCAD), HADHA (encodes
LCHAD and TFP), and HADHB (encodes TFP).
B) Patient will not use any other medium-chain triglyceride products
concomitantly with Dojolvi; AND
C) Patient meets at least ONE of the following (i, ii, or iii):
i. According to the prescriber, the patient has had inadequate efficacy or
significant intolerance to an over-the-counter medium-chain triglyceride
product (e.g. nutraceutical supplements) [other than Dojolvi]; OR
ii. According to the prescriber, the patient has a history of at least one severe
or recurrent manifestation of long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (i.e.,
cardiomyopathy, rhabdomyolysis, or hypoglycemia); OR
iii. Patient is currently receiving Dojolvi; AND
D) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a metabolic disease
specialist or a physician who specializes in the management of long-chain fatty
acid oxidation disorders.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Dojolvi™ (triheptanoin oral liquid – Ultragenyx)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s); criteria will
be updated as new published data are available.
