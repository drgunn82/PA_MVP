INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Skyrizi subcutaneous (SC), an interleukin (IL)-23 blocker, is indicated for the
following uses:1
• Crohn’s disease, in patients with moderate to severe active disease.
• Plaque psoriasis, for treatment of adults with moderate to severe disease
who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
• Psoriatic arthritis, for treatment of adults with active disease.
• Ulcerative colitis, in adults with moderate to severe active disease.
Skyrizi is also available in an intravenous (IV) formulation that is indicated only in
Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). It is administered as an IV infusion
at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 for induction, followed by Skyrizi SC once every 8 weeks
thereafter for maintenance.1 Skyrizi SC is available as a 180 mg or 360 mg single-
Page 1 of 9: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions - Skyrizi
Subcutaneous Prior Authorization Policy
dose prefilled cartridge for use with an on-body injector for use in Crohn’s disease and
ulcerative colitis. For other conditions, Skyrizi is available as a 150 mg single-dose
prefilled pen and as a 75 mg or 150 mg prefilled syringe.
Guidelines
Guidelines for the treatment of inflammatory conditions recommend use of Skyrizi
SC.
• Crohn’s Disease: The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) [2025]
has guidelines for the management of CD in adults.5 In moderate to severe
disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be utilized for
induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended include tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, Entyvio® (vedolizumab), IL-23 inhibitors, IL-
12/23 inhibitors, and Rinvoq® (upadacitinib). If steroids are utilized for
induction, efforts should be made to introduce steroid-sparing agents for
maintenance therapy. Guidelines from the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) [2021] include various biologics among the therapies for
moderate to severe CD, for induction and maintenance of remission.6
• Plaque Psoriasis: Joint guidelines from the American Academy of
Dermatology and National Psoriasis Medical Board (2019) for management of
psoriasis with biologics have been published.2 These guidelines list Skyrizi as
a monotherapy treatment option for patients with moderate to severe plaque
psoriasis. Guidelines from the European Dermatology Forum (2025)
recommend biologics (including Skyrizi SC) as second-line therapy for most
patients requiring systemic treatment when there is inadequate response,
contraindication, or intolerance to conventional systemic agents (e.g.,
methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin).3
• Psoriatic Arthritis: Guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology
(2019) recommend TNF inhibitors over other biologics for use in treatment-
naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis and in those who were previously treated
with an oral therapy.4
• Ulcerative colitis: The AGA (2024) and the ACG (2025) have clinical practice
guidelines on the management of moderate to severe UC.7,8 In moderate to
severe disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be utilized
for induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended include TNF
inhibitors, Entyvio, IL-23 inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, sphingosine-1-
phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. If
steroids are utilized for induction, efforts should be made to introduce steroid-
sparing agents for maintenance therapy. Of note, guidelines state
corticosteroids may be avoided entirely when other effective induction
strategies are planned.8 Both guidelines also recommend that any drug that
effectively treats induction should be continued for maintenance.7,8
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Skyrizi SC.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval
is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Skyrizi SC as well
Page 2 of 9: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions - Skyrizi
Subcutaneous Prior Authorization Policy
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Skyrizi SC to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Skyrizi® (risankizumab-rzaa subcutaneous injection – Abbvie)

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Skyrizi® (risankizumab-rzaa subcutaneous injection – Abbvie)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic disease-modifying
antirheumatic drug (e.g., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or
sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication.
