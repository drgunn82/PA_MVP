INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Sovaldi, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleotide analog non-serine (NS)5B polymerase
inhibitor, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 infection, in adults without cirrhosis or
with compensated cirrhosis as a component of a combination antiviral
treatment.
• Chronic HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection, in pediatric patients ≥ 3 years of
age without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis in combination with
ribavirin.
The place in therapy for Sovaldi has greatly lessened or is non-existent in most cases
due to the availability of other direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) with greater efficacy for
many genotypes. Regimens with Sovaldi + peginterferon + ribavirin or Sovaldi +
weight-based ribavirin are no longer recommended in treatment guidelines with the
exception of pediatric patients due to inferior efficacy compared with other all-oral
regimens for all genotypes. Table 1 provides pediatric recommendations.

Table 1. Sovaldi Treatment Regimen in Pediatric Patients (≥ 3 years of age).1
Patient Population Treatment and Duration
Genotype 2 Treatment-naïve and treatment experienced Sovaldi + ribavirin x 12 weeks
without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis
(Child-Pugh A)
Genotype 3 Treatment-naïve and treatment experienced Sovaldi + ribavirin x 24 weeks
without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis
(Child-Pugh A)
Guidelines
According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
guidelines, weight-based Sovaldi + ribavirin for treatment-naive or interferon-
experienced (± ribavirin) children aged ≥3 years with genotype 2 or 3, without
cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) is no longer favored because
pangenotypic ribavirin-free treatments are now available for children as young as 3
years of age.2 The AASLD recommends Epclusa® (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir tablets and
oral pellets) and Mavyret® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir tablets and oral pellets) for the
treatment of patients ≥ 3 years of age with genotypes 1 through 6 chronic HCV who
are treatment-naïve or interferon-experienced, with or without compensated
cirrhosis; Harvoni® (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir tablets and oral pellets) is also an option
for children ≥ 3 years of age with genotypes 1, 4, 5, or 6 chronic HCV.2
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Sovaldi. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Sovaldi as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and efficacy, approval requires Sovaldi to be
prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition
being treated.
• Sovaldi® (sofosbuvir tablets and oral pellets (Gilead, generic for
tablets only)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype 2. Approve for 12 weeks if the
patient meets ALL of the following (A, B, C, and D):
A) Patient is ≥ 3 years of age and < 18 years of age; AND
B) Patient does not have decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or C); AND
Note: Coverage is provided for patients without cirrhosis or with compensated
(Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis.
C) The medication will be prescribed in combination with ribavirin; AND
D) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist,
hepatologist, infectious diseases physician, or a liver transplant physician.

2. Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype 3. Approve for 24 weeks if the
patient meets ALL of the following (A, B, C, and D):
A) Patient is ≥ 3 years of age and < 18 years of age; AND
B) Patient does not have decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or C); AND
Note: Coverage is provided for patients without cirrhosis or for patients with
compensated (Child-Pugh A) cirrhosis.
C) The medication will be prescribed in combination with ribavirin; AND
D) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist,
hepatologist, infectious diseases physician, or a liver transplant physician.
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
3. Patient Has Been Started on Sovaldi. Approve for an indication or condition
addressed as an approval in the Recommended Authorization Criteria section
(FDA-Approved Indications or Other Uses with Supportive Evidence). Approve the
duration described above to complete a course therapy (e.g., a patient who should
receive 12 weeks and has received 3 weeks should be approved for 9 weeks to
complete their 12-week course).
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Sovaldi® (sofosbuvir tablets and oral pellets (Gilead, generic for
tablets only)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. HCV (Any Genotype), Combination Use with Direct-Acting Antivirals
(DAAs) Other than Ribavirin. In adults with any genotype chronic HCV with or
without compensated cirrhosis who have failed treatment with Mavyret,
retreatment with Mavyret + Sovaldi + ribavirin is a recommended regimen based
on data from a Phase IIIb study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Mavyret +
Sovaldi + weight-based ribavirin as a 12- or 16-week retreatment regimen for
patients who experienced virologic failure to Mavyret within the context of a
previous clinical trial. Non-cirrhotic Mavyret non-responders with genotype 1, 2,
4, 5, or 6 who were naïve to protease and NS5A inhibitors received 12 weeks
Mavyret + Sovaldi and weight-based ribavirin. Patients with genotype 3, and/or
compensated cirrhosis, and/or protease/NS5A experience (prior to their initial
Mavyret treatment) received 16 weeks of therapy with the same regimen. In a
preliminary analysis, 96% (n = 22/23) of these patients achieved SVR with a
single relapse in a cirrhotic patient with genotype 1a. Vosevi is also a
recommended regimen in this instance and it is FDA-approved for such use.
2. Monotherapy with Sovaldi. Sovaldi is indicated as a component of a
combination antiviral treatment regimen for HCV.1

3. Pediatric Patients (Age < 3 years). The safety and efficacy of Sovaldi have not
been established in pediatric patients < 3 years of age.1
