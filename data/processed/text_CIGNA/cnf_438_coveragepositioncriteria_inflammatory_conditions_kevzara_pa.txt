INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Kevzara, an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of the
following conditions:1
• Rheumatoid arthritis, in adults with moderate to severe active disease who
have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
• Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, for the treatment of active
disease in patients who weigh ≥ 63 kg.
• Polymyalgia rheumatica, in adults who have had an inadequate response to
corticosteroids or who cannot tolerate corticosteroid taper.
Guidelines
Kevzara is addressed in the following guidelines:
Page 1 of 7 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Kevzara Prior Authorization
Policy
• Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from the American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) [2021] recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted
synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of
methotrexate who is not at target.2
• Polyarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Guidelines specific to juvenile
non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis (2019) were published
prior to approval of Kevzara for PJIA.5 For patients without risk factors, initial
therapy with a DMARD is conditionally recommended over a biologic. Biologics
are conditionally recommended as initial treatment when combined with a
DMARD over biologic monotherapy.
• Polymyalgia Rheumatica: Guidelines from the European League Against
Rheumatism (EULAR)/ACR (2015) were published prior to approval of Kevzara
for this condition.4 The minimum effective individualized duration of
glucocorticoid therapy is strongly recommended.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Kevzara. All
approvals are provided for the approval duration noted below. In cases where the
approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Kevzara as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy,
initial approval requires Kevzara to be prescribed by or in consultation with a
physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Kevzara® (sarilumab subcutaneous injection – Regeneron/Sanofi-
Aventis)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Rheumatoid Arthritis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE
of the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets ALL of the following

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Kevzara® (sarilumab subcutaneous injection – Regeneron/Sanofi-
Aventis)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Ankylosing Spondylitis. In a Phase II study, Kevzara did not demonstrate
efficacy in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.3
2. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
