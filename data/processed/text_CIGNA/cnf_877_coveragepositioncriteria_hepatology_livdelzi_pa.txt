INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Livdelzi, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-delta agonist, is
indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination
with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or
as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.1
Livdelzi was approved under accelerated approval based on reduction in alkaline
phosphatase (ALP).1 An improvement in survival or liver decompensation events has
not been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon
verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.
Limitation of use: Livdelzi is not recommended in patients who have or develop
decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy).
Guidelines
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hepatology – Livdelzi Prior Authorization Policy
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines for
primary biliary cholangitis (2018) state that the diagnosis can be confirmed when
patients meet two of the following criteria: 1) there is cholestasis as evidenced by
alkaline phosphatase elevation; 2) anti-mitochondrial antibodies are present, or if
negative for anti-mitochondrial antibodies, other primary biliary cholangitis-specific
autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210, are present; 3) there is histologic evidence
of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular bile ducts.
It is specifically noted that diagnosis in a patient who is negative for anti-
mitochondrial antibodies does not require a liver biopsy if other diagnostic criteria
are met.2 Treatment with UDCA (available in the US as ursodiol) is the recommended
treatment for patients with primary biliary cholangitis who have abnormal liver
enzyme values regardless of histologic stage. Following 12 months of UDCA therapy,
the patient should be evaluated to determine if second-line therapy is appropriate. It
is estimated that up to 40% of patients have an inadequate response to UDCA;
Ocaliva® (obeticholic acid tablets), a faresoid X receptor agonist, should be
considered for these patients. An update to the 2018 AASLD guidelines for primary
biliary cholangitis (2021) provide two updated recommendations:3 1) Fibrates can
be considered as off-label alternatives for patients with primary biliary cholangitis
and inadequate response to UDCA. However, fibrates are discouraged in patients
with decompensated liver disease; and 2) Ocaliva is contraindicated in patients with
advanced cirrhosis, defined as cirrhosis with current or prior evidence of liver
decompensation (e.g., encephalopathy, coagulopathy) or portal hypertension (e.g.,
ascites, gastroesophageal varices, or persistent thrombocytopenia). In addition, the
AASLD recommends careful monitoring of any patient with cirrhosis, even if not
advanced, receiving Ocaliva.
Safety
The safety and efficacy of Livdelzi in patients with decompensated cirrhosis have not
been established.1 Use of Livdelzi is not recommended in patients who have or
develop decompensated cirrhosis (e.g., ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatic
encephalopathy). Patients with cirrhosis should be monitored for evidence of
decompensation. Consider discontinuing Livdelzi if the patient progresses to
moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Livdelzi. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Livdelzi as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Livdelzi to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.

is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Primary Biliary Cholangitis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Livdelzi™ (seladelpar capsules – Gilead)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Alcoholic Liver Disease. There are no data available to support the use of
Livdelzi in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.
2. Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease
(MASLD)/Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), including Metabolic
Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH)/Non-Alcoholic
Steatohepatitis (NASH). There is not sufficient data available to support the
use of Livdelzi in patients with MASLD/NAFLD. Clinical development of Livdelzi for
MASH was halted after liver biopsies of some patients had shown evidence of
interface hepatitis.4 Although an independent panel of hepatologists and
pathologists concluded there was no chemical, biochemical, or histological
evidence this was attributed to active treatment, resumption of the clinical
program was not pursued.
3. Concomitant use with Ocaliva (obeticholic acid tablets) or Iqirvo
(elafibranor tablets). There are no data available to support the use of Livdelzi
in combination with Ocaliva or Iqirvo in patients with PBC.
