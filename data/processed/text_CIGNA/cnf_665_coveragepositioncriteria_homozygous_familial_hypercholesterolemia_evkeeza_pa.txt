CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Evkeeza, an angiopoietin-like 3 inhibitor, is indicated as an adjunct to other low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapies for the treatment of
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) in patients ≥ 5 years of age.1
In the pivotal trial that led to approval of Evkeeza, patients were receiving additional
medications to lower LDL-C levels such as statins (94% [77% of patients at high-
intensity statin doses]), a proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
inhibitor (77%), ezetimibe (75%), and Juxtapid® (lomitapide capsules). Although
some Phase II data are available,3 the safety and effectiveness of Evkeeza have not
been established in patients with other causes of hypercholesterolemia, including
those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).1 The effects of
Evkeeza on cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality have not been determined.

Prior Authorization Policy
Disease Overview
Familial hypercholesterolemias, which include HeFH and HoFH, encompass a group
of genetic defects that cause severe elevations in LDL-C levels, as well as other lipid
parameters.4,5 HoFH impacts approximately 1 in 300,000 to 1,000,000 persons. The
condition is most commonly due to impaired functionality of the low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) receptor which leads to a low or absence of clearance of LDL-C from
the circulation. Currently known causes of familial hypercholesterolemia include
mutations in the LDL receptor, apolipoprotein B, or PCSK9 genes. Patients with
familial hypercholesterolemia may have physical findings such as tendon or
cutaneous xanthomas, which may occur in childhood. Individuals with familial
hypercholesterolemia are at very high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD) at a premature age. Most guidelines recommended LDL-C targets of < 100
mg/dL for adults and < 70 mg/dL for adults with ASCVD or other risk factors. Statins
are the initial treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia. For patients with HoFH,
high-intensity statin therapy is recommended, with ezetimibe added as well. Therapy
with a PCSK9 inhibitor (e.g., Repatha® [evolocumab subcutaneous injection],
Praluent® [alirocumab subcutaneous injection]) is usually the next step. Juxtapid
can be added onto maximal lipid-lowering therapy and Evkeeza may be considered.
Combination therapy is required for most patients. LDL apheresis is recommended
in certain circumstances. The diagnosis of HoFH can be done by genetic or clinical
criteria.5 An untreated LDL-C > 400 mg/dL is suggestive of HoFH. Patients may
have cutaneous or tendon xanthomas before 10 years of age and/or untreated
elevated LDL-C levels consistent with HeFH in both parents. In the digenic form, one
parent may have normal LDL-C levels and the other may have LDL-C levels consistent
with HoFH.
Guidelines
Guidelines provide strategies for managing familial hypercholesterolemia, including
HoFH, and mention the role of Evkeeza.5,6
• American College of Cardiology (2022): Specialized therapies, one of
which includes Evkeeza, may be needed to control LDL-C in certain patients
(e.g., those with HoFH) who have had an inadequate response to statins, with
or without ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors.6
• European Atherosclerosis Society (2023): Clinical guidance by this
organization recommends lipid-lowering therapy be initiated with high-
intensity statin therapy and ezetimibe.5 A PCSK9 inhibitor can be added as
well. If patients are not at LDL-C goals, other agents can be alternatives as
well (e.g., Juxtapid, Evkeeza). Lipoprotein apheresis may also be considered.
The goal is to reduce LDL-C to < 115 mg/dL in children and adolescents, < 70
mg/dL in adults if no major ASCVD risk factors are present, and < 55 mg/dL if
patients have ASCVD or major ASCVD risk factors.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Evkeeza. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. A patient who has previously
met Initial Therapy criteria for Evkeeza for the requested indication under the
Coverage Review Department and is currently receiving Evkeeza is only required to

criteria has not been met under the Coverage Review Department and the patient is
currently receiving Evkeeza, or is restarting Evkeeza, Initial Therapy criteria must be
met.

HISTORY
Type of Summary of Changes Review
Revision Date
Annual No criteria changes. 03/08/2023
Revision
Selected Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: The age of 03/29/2023
Revision approval was changed to ≥ 5 years of age; previously, a patient had
to be ≥ 12 years of age. Also, criteria were revised to not require a
patient 5 to 9 years of age to try one proprotein convertase subtilisin
kexin type 9 inhibitor.
Early Annual It was added to the Policy Statement that only a patient who has 04/26/2023
Revision previously met initial therapy criteria for Evkeeza for the requested
indication under the Coverage Review Department and is currently
receiving Evkeeza is only required to meet continuation of therapy
criteria (i.e., currently receiving therapy). If past criteria has not been
met under the Coverage Review Department and the patient is
currently receiving Evkeeza, or is restarting Evkeeza, initial therapy
criteria must be met. In addition, the following changes were made:
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: Requirements were
divided to distinguish between initial therapy and patient currently
receiving Evkeeza (previously there was only one criteria set). For a
patient who is currently receiving Evkeeza and has previously met
initial therapy criteria for the requested indication under the Coverage
Review Department, only the continuation of therapy criteria has to
be met. The continuation of therapy criteria states that according to
the prescribing physician, the patient has experienced a response to
therapy with examples provided in a Note.
Annual It was removed from the Policy Statement that the agent is prescribing 05/08/2024
Revision by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition
being treated. In addition, the following changes were made:
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: For Initial Therapy,
the requirement that the medication is prescribed by or in consultation
with a cardiologist, an endocrinologist, or a physician who focuses in
the treatment of cardiovascular risk management and/or lipid
disorders was removed. The requirement that the patient has had
genetic confirmation by two mutant alleles at the low-density
lipoprotein receptor, apolipoprotein B, proprotein convertase subtilisin
kexin type 9, or low-density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1
gene locus was changed to state that the patient has phenotypic
confirmation of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia with the
above examples moved to a Note. The diagnostic criterion which
stated that the patient has an untreated low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol level > 500 mg/dL was changed to > 400 mg/dL. The
criterion (which is in two places [those with an untreated low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol level > 400 mg/dL and a treated low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol level ≥ 300 mg/dL]) that both parents of the
patient had untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or
total cholesterol levels consistent with heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia was changed to state that at least one parent of
the patient had untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or
total cholesterol levels consistent with familial hypercholesterolemia.
The related Note that “An example of heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia in both parents would be if both had an
untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level ≥ 190 mg/dL
and/or an untreated total cholesterol level > 250 mg/dL” was changed
to state “An example of familial hypercholesterolemia is an untreated
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level ≥ 190 mg/dL and/or an
untreated total cholesterol level > 250 mg/dL.” For a Patient Currently

Receiving the Medication, the requirement that the “prescribing
physician” notes that the patient has experienced a response to
therapy was changed to “prescriber”.
Annual Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: For Initial Therapy, 05/28/2025
Revision the phrase “phenotypic confirmation of homozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia” was replaced with “The diagnosis has been
