CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Daybue is indicated for the treatment of Rett syndrome in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 2
years of age.1
Disease Overview
Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by typical early growth and
development followed by a slowing of development, loss of functional use of the hands,
distinctive hand movements, slowed brain and head growth, problems with walking,
seizures, and intellectual disability.2 The course of Rett syndrome, including the age of
onset and the severity of symptoms, varies from child to child. However, symptoms of Rett
syndrome usually appear in children between 6 to 18 months as they begin to miss
developmental milestones or lose abilities they had gained.3 Rett syndrome occurs
worldwide in 1 of every 10,000 to 15,000 female births and is even rarer in males. Rett
syndrome is estimated to affect all racial and ethnic groups worldwide.2 Nearly all cases of
Rett syndrome are caused by a mutation in the methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2)
gene. The MECP2 gene contains instructions for the synthesis of a protein called methyl
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Neurology – Daybue Prior Authorization Policy
cytosine binding protein 2 (MeCP2), which is needed for brain development and acts as a
biochemical switch that can increase or decrease gene expression.
Typical, or classic, Rett syndrome is defined by the presence of the characteristic disease
progression of Rett syndrome, a period of regression followed by recovery or stabilization.4,5
The diagnosis of classic/typical Rett syndrome requires all main diagnostic criteria and none
of the exclusion criteria. The main Rett syndrome diagnostic criteria are: 1) partial or
complete loss of acquired purposeful hand skills; 2) partial or complete loss of acquired
spoken language; 3) gait abnormalities, i.e., impaired (dyspraxic) or absence of ability; and
4) stereotypic hand movements, such as hand wringing/squeezing, clapping/tapping,
mouthing and washing/rubbing automatisms. The exclusion criteria for classic/typical Rett
syndrome are: 1) brain injury secondary to trauma (peri- or postnatally), neurometabolic
disease, or severe infection that causes neurological problems; and 2) grossly abnormal
psychomotor development in first 6 months of life. Additionally, clinicians have also
identified individuals that display some, but not all, of the features of typical Rett
syndrome.4 These individuals are described to have atypical, or variant, Rett syndrome.
Atypical Rett syndrome is defined by the presence of a period of regression followed by
recovery or stabilization, as well as at least 2 of the main 4 criteria for typical Rett
syndrome and at least 5 of the 11 supporting criteria: breathing disturbances when awake;
bruxism when awake; impaired sleep pattern; abnormal muscle tone; peripheral vasomotor
disturbances; scoliosis/kyphosis; growth retardation; small cold hands and feet;
inappropriate laughing/screaming spells; diminished response to pain; and intense eye
communication, use of eye pointing.5
Because MECP2 mutations are now identified in some individuals prior to any clear evidence
of regression, the diagnosis of “possible” Rett syndrome should be given to those individuals
< 3 years of age who have not lost any skills but otherwise have clinical features suggestive
of Rett syndrome.5 These individuals should be reassessed every 6 to 12 months for
evidence of regression. If regression manifests, the diagnosis should then be changed to
definite Rett syndrome. However, if the child does not show any evidence of regression by 5
years of age, the diagnosis of Rett syndrome should be questioned.
Clinical Efficacy
The current Daybue efficacy information is insufficient to determine if the medication
demonstrates any clinically meaningful benefits.6-10 In the absence of additional clinical
trials, there is not enough information to support approval. The efficacy of Daybue was
evaluated in one pivotal trial called LAVENDER that assessed Daybue in female patients with
Rett syndrome.6,7 Confirmatory evidence of efficacy was provided by RETT-002, a non-
pivotal, dose-ranging trial that evaluated Daybue in female patients with Rett syndrome.8
Evidence for effectiveness in patients 2 to 4 years of age with Rett syndrome was provided
by a bridging pharmacokinetic study, DAFFODIL.7 For each of these studies, patients were
enrolled if they had a diagnosis of typical Rett syndrome, according to the Rett syndrome
diagnostic criteria, with a documented disease-causing mutation in the MECP2 gene, and
were post-regression status for ≥ 6 months at screening (i.e., no loss or degradation in
ambulation, hand function, speech, nonverbal communicative or social skills).6-8 Daybue
has been evaluated for up to 40 weeks in LILAC, a published, open-label extension study of
the 12-week, placebo-controlled LAVENDER study in patients with Rett syndrome, and for
up to 32 months in LILAC-2, a published, open-label extension study of LILAC.9,10 LILAC
enrolled 154 patients who had completed LAVENDER and LILAC-2 enrolled 77 patients who
had completed LILAC.

POLICY STATEMENT
Due to the lack of clinical efficacy data and safety concerns, approval is not
recommended for Daybue. The current Daybue efficacy information is insufficient to
determine if the medication demonstrates any clinically meaningful benefits. In the absence
of additional clinical trials, there is not enough information to support approval.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Daybue™ (trofinetide oral solution - Acadia)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY use(s) including the following
(this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as new published data
are available):
1. Rett Syndrome. The efficacy of Daybue was evaluated in one pivotal trial called
LAVENDER that assessed Daybue in female patients with Rett syndrome.6,7 A non-
pivotal, dose-ranging trial, RETT-002, also evaluated Daybue in female patients with
Rett syndrome.8 Evidence for use in patients 2 to 4 years of age with Rett syndrome
was provided by a bridging pharmacokinetic study, DAFFODIL.7 For each of these
studies, patients were enrolled if they had a diagnosis of typical Rett syndrome,
according to the Rett syndrome diagnostic criteria, with a documented disease-causing
mutation in the MECP2 gene, and were post-regression status for ≥ 6 months at
screening (i.e., no loss or degradation in ambulation, hand function, speech, nonverbal
communicative or social skills).6-8 After 12 weeks, LAVENDER demonstrated marginal
efficacy on the subjective co-primary efficacy endpoints of the Rett Syndrome Behaviour
Questionnaire (RSBQ) [the scale ranges from 0 to 90] and the Clinical Global
Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) score (scale ranges from 0 to 7).6,7 The open-label
extension studies (LILAC [up to 40 weeks on therapy] and LILAC-2 [up to 32 months on
therapy]) continued to demonstrate marginal clinical efficacy on the RSBQ and CGI-I
scores and continued high rates of diarrhea and vomiting.9,10
