CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Miplyffa is indicated in combination with miglustat for the treatment of neurological
manifestations of Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) in patients ≥ 2 years of
age.1
The FDA concluded that data are insufficient to determine the effectiveness of
Miplyffa without miglustat for the treatment of neurological manifestations in
patients with NPC.1
Disease Overview
NPC is an autosomal recessive, progressive lysosomal storage disorder.5 NPC is
considered an ultra-rare disease with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100,000 live
births; however, this is thought to underestimate individuals with later onset
disease.4-6 NPC is caused by mutations in NPC1 (90% to 95%) or NPC2 (5%) that
yield deficient function of the corresponding proteins that normally bind and
transport cholesterol.6 The lysosomal dysfunction in NPC leads to an accumulation
of lipids in the brain, liver, and spleen.
The presentation of NPC is heterogeneous characterized by visceral, neurological, or
psychiatric symptoms that may present at any age with variable rates of

Authorization Policy
progression.4 Patients have difficulties with walking, swallowing, speaking,
concentration, and/or memory. The age of onset of neurological symptoms predicts
the severity of the disease and determines life expectancy; NPC is classified
according to the age of onset of neurological manifestations. Three forms of NPC
are described: 1) visceral-neurodegenerative (< 2 years [early infantile]); 2)
neurodegenerative (2 to 6 years [late infantile] and 6 to 15 years [juvenile]; and 3)
psychiatric-neurodegenerative (> 15 years [adults]). Patients with infantile and
juvenile-onset NPC are usually severely impacted by the disease; however, patients
with adolescent- or adult-onset NPC likely make up the largest patient group in
terms of prevalence (estimated to be ≥ 20%). The spectrum of NPC ranges from a
neonatal rapidly progressive fatal disorder to an adult-onset chronic
neurodegenerative disease. In addition, atypical presentations (fatal systemic
perinatal form and initial systemic disease) constitute a small, but significant,
proportion of cases.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Miplyffa was evaluated in one Phase II/III, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, pivotal study in patients ≥ 2 to ≤ 18 years of
age with genetically confirmed NPC (n = 50).2 The confirmed diagnosis of NPC met
one of the following: 1) genetically confirmed mutation in both alleles of NPC1 or
NPC2; OR 2) mutation in only one allele of NPC1 or NPC2 plus either positive filipin
staining or elevated cholestane-triol level (> 2 times the upper limit of normal).
Patients had at least one neurological sign of NPC and the ability to walk
independently or with assistance. Concurrent use of miglustat was allowed; 78% of
patients were taking miglustat. The mean age was 11.1 years. The mean age of
first neurological symptom was 5.1 years; 48% of patients had late infantile-onset
NPC (2 to < 6 years of age), 34% of patients had juvenile-onset NPC (6 to 15 years
of age), and 16% of patients had early infantile-onset NPC (3 months to < 2 years
of age). No patients with adult-onset NPC (age > 15 years at first neurological
symptom) were enrolled. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in NPC
disease severity from baseline to Month 12 assessed by the 5-domain NPC Clinical
Severity Scale (NPCCSS) score (5 domains: ambulation, cognition, fine motor
skills, speech, and swallowing; scores range from 0 to 25, higher scores indicate
more severe clinical impairment). The mean baseline 5-domain NPCCSS scores
were 12.1 points and 9.4 points in the Miplyffa and placebo groups, respectively.
Results. At Month 12, the mean change from baseline on the 5-domain NPCCSS
score significantly favored Miplyffa vs. placebo in the overall population (mean
+0.76 points vs. +2.15 points, respectively; difference -1.40 points; P = 0.046);
difference corresponds to a 65% reduction in annual disease progression. The
treatment effect of Miplyffa (vs. placebo) on the 5-domain NPCCSS score was
enhanced in the subgroups of patients ≥ 4 years of age (n = 44) [mean change
+0.40 vs. +2.20, respectively; difference -1.80 points; P = 0.016; 103% reduction
in annual disease progression] and in patients taking miglustat (n = 39) [mean
change -0.06 points vs. +2.01 points, respectively; difference -2.06; P = 0.006;
82% reduction in annual disease progression]. There was no significant difference
between Miplyffa and placebo in the proportion of responders (stable or improved
5-domain NPCCSS scores) [50.0% vs. 37.5% of patients, respectively]. Further, a
similar proportion of patients had a 2-point (or greater) worsening on the 5-domain
7 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Niemann-Pick Disease Type C – Miplyffa Prior Authorization
Policy
NPCCSS at Month 12 (~44% of patients). At Month 12, there were no significant
differences between Miplyffa and placebo for secondary endpoints.
Data from the 4-year open-label extension (5 years of exposure to Miplyffa) have
been presented (unpublished); 29 patients (71%) completed the open-label
extension.3 Generally, the severity of disease progressed slowly over the open-
label extension in a stepwise pattern. In patients who continued Miplyffa from the
pivotal trial, the mean change in the 4-domain NPCCSS score (4 domains:
ambulation, speech, swallowing, and fine motor; scores range from 0 to 20, higher
scores indicate more severe clinical impairment) for each year in the open-label
extension was variable and showed an initial worsening (4-domain NPCCSS +1.4
points for the first 1 year of the open-label extension [Months 12 to 24]). The
mean year-to-year change in the 4-domain NPCCSS score for the following 3 years
(Years 2, 3, and 4) was +1.1 points, +0.3 points, and +0.8 points, respectively.
The increase in disease progression during the first 1-year of the open-label
extension was attributed to a small number of patients who were not taking
miglustat and had rapid disease progression.
Guidelines
Consensus clinical management guidelines for NPC have been developed by the
International Niemann-Pick Disease Registry (INPDR) project (2018).4 Disease-
modifying therapy is discussed; however, Miplyffa is only mentioned as an agent in
development. Optimal disease management includes a multidisciplinary team (e.g.,
primary care physician, metabolic disease specialist, neurologist, psychiatrist,
anesthesiologist, neuro-ophthalmologist, neuropsychologist, speech and language
therapist, occupational and physical therapists, nutritionist, gastroenterologist,
social worker, genetic counselor) based in a specialty care center. The mainstay of
therapy is symptom management with disease-modifying agents when available.
Patients should be assessed for growth and developmental delay, mobility,
swallowing and diet, speech, spasticity, bowel and bladder dysfunction, cataplexy,
mental well-being, hypersalivation/drooling, and hearing.
Regarding disease-modifying therapies, all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of
NPC should be considered for miglustat (strength of recommendation: 2; level of
evidence C; 13% of experts completely agree, 38% mostly agree, 13% partially
agree, 25% mostly disagree, and 13% completely disagree).4 However, there are
several instances in which miglustat is not recommended: patients who are pre-
symptomatic or have only spleen or liver enlargement, those with advanced
neurological disease (e.g., inability to ambulate without a wheelchair, complete lack
of verbal communication, swallowing difficulties profound enough to require tube
feeding through a percutaneous gastrostomy) or dementia (e.g., need for 24-hour
care), and patients with another life-threatening illness with estimated lifespan < 1
year (noted not to be based on evidence). Note: In the US, miglustat is indicated
as monotherapy for the treatment of adults with mild/moderate type 1 Gaucher
disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option.8
However, in other countries, it is approved for the management of neurologic
manifestations of NPC.5

Policy
Treatment goals should be established at diagnosis and reviewed regularly
(generally every 6 to 12 months) and aimed at improving or maintaining the
physical and psychosocial well-being of the patient.4
NPC Diagnosis
When NPC is clinically suspected, diagnosis can be confirmed by the combination of
biochemical and molecular genetic studies.4 In any individual in whom the
diagnosis of NPC is considered based on their clinical manifestations and/or
abnormal biomarker profile genetic testing for NPC genes should be conducted to
confirm the diagnosis. Mutation analysis of NPC1 and NPC2 genes is mandatory to
confirm the diagnosis of NPC. It is also the only reliable method to diagnose NPC
carriers within a family and the highly preferred strategy for prenatal diagnosis.
The identification of two alleles with known disease-causing mutations in either
NPC1 or NPC2 gene confirms the diagnosis of NPC. Approximately 700 NPC1
variants have been reported among which around 420 are considered pathogenic,
with only a limited number being common (p.I1061T, pP1007A) or recurrent
mutations. Interpretation of new missense and splicing mutations should be
undertaken with caution and their pathogenicity must be verified. The presence of
very severe mutations (frameshift, nonsense, large deletion) in both alleles often
results in early-infantile neurological disease (with a higher risk of severe, possibly
fatal, systemic disease). Approximately 26 pathogenic NPC2 mutations have been
described. Most are frameshift of nonsense as well as large deletion variants that
leads to a severe clinical phenotype. Among the missense mutations in NPC2, two
variants (p.V39 M and p.P120S) have been associated with the juvenile or adult
forms of the disease. More patients from North Africa, Italy, and Turkey have been
identified with NPC2 mutations.
The filipin test is no longer considered a first-line test for the diagnosis of NPC;
however, it remains a very useful diagnostic tool in uncertain cases where
biomarkers and/or molecular analysis provide inconclusive results and to assess the
pathogenicity of novel genetic variants. This assay needs to be performed on
cultured fibroblasts from skin biopsies; it is invasive and has a long turnaround
time. Further the assay is technically challenging, labor intensive, and is only
performed in specialized laboratories. If only one pathogenic mutation is identified
by molecular analysis of NPC1 and NPC2, filipin testing should be performed.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Miplyffa.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Miplyffa as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Miplyffa to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Miplyffa™ (arimoclomol capsules - Zevra)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria
will be updated as new published data are available):
1. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Arimoclomol did not improve efficacy
outcomes relative to placebo in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A
multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial
assessed the efficacy of arimoclomol (400 mg three times daily) vs. placebo in
adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (n = 245).10 The primary outcome was
the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS) rank score over 76
weeks of treatment. At Week 76, the CAFS score did not differ between
arimoclomol and placebo groups (mean 0.51 vs 0.49, respectively; P = non-
significant). Proportions of participants who died were similar between the
treatment groups (18% [n = 29/160] and 23% [n = 18/79] of patients in the
arimoclomol and placebo groups, respectively). Most deaths were due to
disease progression.
2. Combination use with Aqneursa (levacetylleucine granules). Aqneursa is
indicated for the treatment of neurological manifestations of Niemann-Pick
disease Type C in patients ≥ 15 kg.11 There are no data available regarding
combination use of Aqneursa and Miplyffa.
3. Gaucher Disease. A Phase II study with arimoclomol in patients with Gaucher
disease type 1 or 3 was terminated; the Coronavirus disease-19 pandemic
prevented the ability to assess the trial objective.7 Additional data are needed
to determine if arimoclomol is beneficial in patients with Gaucher disease type 1
or 3.
4. Inclusion Body Myositis. Arimoclomol did not improve efficacy outcomes
relative to placebo in patients with inclusion body myositis. A multicenter,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessed the efficacy of
arimoclomol (400 mg three times daily) vs. placebo in adults with inclusion body
myositis fulfilling the European Neuromuscular Center research diagnostic
criteria 2011 (n = 152).9 The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to
Month 20 in the Inclusion Body Myositis Functional Rating Scale (IBMFRS) total
score. At Month 20, the mean IBMFRS change from baseline was not
significantly different between arimoclomol and placebo (-3.26; 95% confidence
interval:
-4.15, -2.36; P = non-significant).
5. Coverage is not recommended for circumstances not listed in the Recommended
Authorization Criteria. Criteria will be updated as new published data are
available.
