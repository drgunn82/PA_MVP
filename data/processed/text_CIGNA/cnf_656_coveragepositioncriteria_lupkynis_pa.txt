REVIEW DATE: 03/19/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Lupkynis, a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant, is indicated in combination with a
background immunosuppressive therapy regimen for the treatment of active lupus
nephritis in adults.1
Limitations of Use: Lupkynis safety and efficacy have not been established in combination
with cyclophosphamide and this combination is not recommended.1
Guidelines
Guidelines for the management of lupus nephritis from Kidney Disease: Improving Global
Outcomes (KDIGO) [2024] recommend Benlysta or Lupkynis in combination with other
medications plus glucocorticoids as initial treatment options for patients with active Class III
or IV (± Class V) biopsy confirmed lupus nephritis (strong recommendation, moderate
certainty of evidence).3 No preference is given between the treatment protocol options;
however, the KDIGO guidelines do provide individual patient clinical factors to consider,
including but not limited to, kidney function and histology, risk of disease flare, proteinuria,
background suppression, and need for parenteral therapy.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Lupkynis. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Lupus – Lupkynis Prior Authorization Policy
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Lupkynis as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires Lupkynis
to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
• Lupkynis® (voclosporin capsules – Aurinia)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for
FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Lupus Nephritis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of the
following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets ALL of the following (i, ii,
iii, iv, and v):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Diagnosis of lupus nephritis has been confirmed on biopsy; AND
Note: For example, World Health Organization class III, IV, or V lupus nephritis.
iii. The medication is being used concurrently with an immunosuppressive regimen;
AND
Note: Examples of an immunosuppressive regimen include mycophenolate
mofetil or azathioprine with a systemic corticosteroid.
iv. Patient has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) > 45 mL/min/m2; AND
v. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a nephrologist or
rheumatologist.
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Lupkynis. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL
of the following (i, ii, iii, and iv):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. The medication is being used concurrently with an immunosuppressive regimen;
AND
Note: Examples of an immunosuppressive regimen include mycophenolate
mofetil or azathioprine with a systemic corticosteroid.
iii. Patient has responded to Lupkynis, as determined by the prescriber; AND
Note: Examples of a response include improvement in organ dysfunction,
reduction in flares, reduction in corticosteroid dose, decrease of anti-double
stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) titer, and improvement in complement levels (i.e.,
C3, C4).
iv. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a nephrologist or
rheumatologist.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Lupkynis® (voclosporin capsules – Aurinia)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other use(s)
including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated
as new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with Biologics or with Cyclophosphamide. Lupkynis has not been
studied in combination with other biologics or cyclophosphamide.1 Safety and efficacy
4 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Lupus – Lupkynis Prior Authorization Policy
have not been established with these combinations. See APPENDIX for examples of
biologics that should not be taken in combination with Lupkynis.
2. Plaque Psoriasis. In a Phase III trial, voclosporin was inferior to cyclosporine, which is
an established therapy for plaque psoriasis.4 Numerous other FDA-approved therapies
are available with established efficacy for plaque psoriasis.
3. Coverage is not recommended for circumstances not listed in the Recommended
Authorization Criteria. Criteria will be updated as new published data are available.

HISTORY
Type of Summary of Changes Review
Revision Date
Annual Lupus Nephritis: For initial therapy, a requirement was 03/08/2023
Revision added that the patient has biopsy-confirmed lupus
nephritis. For initial therapy and a patient currently taking
Lupkynis, the requirement that the patient be taking
mycophenolate mofetil and a corticosteroid was changed
to more generally require that the patient be taking an
immunosuppressive regimen. Mycophenolate mofetil or
azathioprine with a systemic corticosteroid were added as
examples of immunosuppressive regimens. The exception
for a patient who is not a candidate for mycophenolate
mofetil and a systemic corticosteroid due to inadequate
efficacy or significant intolerance with these medications
was removed from the policy.
Selected Lupus Nephritis: For initial therapy, the requirement 07/05/2023
Revision that the “Patient has autoantibody-positive systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE), defined as positive for antinuclear
antibodies (ANA) and/or anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-
dsDNA) antibody” was removed from the policy.
