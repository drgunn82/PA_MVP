CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Imcivree, a melanocortin 4 receptor agonist, is indicated to reduce excess body
weight and maintain weight reduction long term by reducing hunger and food intake
and increasing energy expenditure in patients ≥ 2 years of age with monogenic or
syndromic obesity due to:1
• Proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin
type 1 (PCSK1), or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency, as determined by
an FDA-approved test demonstrating variants in POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR genes
that are interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of uncertain
significance.
• Bardet-Biedl Syndrome.
As a limitation of use, Imcivree is not indicated for obesity due to suspected POMC,
PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency with POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR variants classified as benign
or likely benign.1 Imcivree is also not indicated for obesity not related to POMC,
PCSK1, or LEPR deficiency or not related to Bardet-Biedl syndrome, including obesity
associated with other genetic syndromes and general (polygenic) obesity.
In the pivotal trial for Imcivree regarding obesity due to POMC deficiency
(homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in POMC or PCSK1) or LEPR
deficiency (homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in LEPR), obesity was
Page 1 of 7 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Metabolic Disorders – Imcivree Prior Authorization Policy
defined according to patient age.2 For patients 6 to < 18 years of age, obesity was
defined as body weight ≥ 95th percentile for age on growth chart assessment. For
patients ≥ 18 years of age, obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30
kg/m2.
The use of Imcivree in pediatric patients 2 to < 6 years of age is supported by a 1-
year open-label study in 12 pediatric patients with POMC or LEPR deficiency or
Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (patients with PCSK1 were eligible, but none were enrolled).1
POMC and LEPR deficiency were confirmed by genetic testing demonstrating biallelic
variants interpreted as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, or of undetermined
significance; Bardet-Biedl Syndrome was diagnosed clinically with genetic
confirmation. Obesity was defined as baseline BMI ≥ 97th percentile for age and sex
and body weight ≥ 20 kg.
Per the Imcivree prescribing information, select patients for treatment with Imcivree
who have a clinical diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome.1 It is noted that in the pivotal
trial, adults had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and pediatric patients had a weight ≥ 97th
percentile using growth chart assessments. Patients were enrolled who had a clinical
diagnosis of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. The clinical diagnosis was based on Beales
criteria, which require that four primary features, or three primary and two secondary
features, of Bardet-Biedl syndrome be met.3
The percentage of body weight loss from baseline or percentage of baseline BMI for
a patient with continued growth potential was assessed as the efficacy endpoints in
the clinical trials. Patients with < 5% weight loss or < 5% of BMI loss were not
considered to have a response to Imcivree (assessed at 1 year in patients with
Bardet-Biedl syndrome and after 12 weeks in patients with POMC, PCSK1, or LEPR
deficiency).
Disease Overview
Monogenic obesity is a rare and severe early-onset form of obesity.4 Unlike general
obesity, environmental factors are much less impactful on obesity development in
these patients. Fewer than 50 patients worldwide have been identified with POMC
deficiency (POMC or PCSK1 mutations); the prevalence of LEPR deficiency is unknown
but is expected to account for less than 3% of severe early-onset obesity. The true
prevalence of these disorders is unknown and likely underestimated due to lack of
provider awareness and genetic testing.2 Clinical presentation is mainly characterized
by major hyperphagia and ravenous hunger.3 Patients with these disorders
experience very rapid and early increase in weight, occurring within the first few days
of life to early childhood. Lifestyle interventions may provide initial weight loss but
are very difficult to maintain long-term in this population due to constant, insatiable
hunger.5 Isolated case reports of bariatric surgery have demonstrated some efficacy
but are generally regarded as disappointing relative to the general population, likely
related to the underlying energy imbalance. Caution is urged before considering
bariatric surgery in patients with monogenic obesity disorders.
Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a rare genetic disease of obesity with an estimated
prevalence of 1:100,000 individuals in Northern Europe and America, although the
prevalence can be higher in certain consanguineous populations.6 It is generally
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Metabolic Disorders – Imcivree Prior Authorization Policy
inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. There are many gene mutations which
are known to lead to the development of Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Additionally, an
estimated 20% to 30% of patients with Bardet-Biedl syndrome do not have an
identified genetic mutation. Diagnosis is based on the presence of characteristic
clinical findings.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Imcivree. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Imcivree as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Imcivree to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated.
