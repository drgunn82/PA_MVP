INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Nitisinone products are hydroxy-phenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitors. Orfadin
and Nityr are indicated for the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 in
combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine in adult and
pediatric patients.1,2 Harliku is indicated for the treatment of alkaptonuria in
adults.3
Disease Overview
Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type 1
Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated blood
levels of the amino acid tyrosine.4,5 It is caused by mutations in the FAH gene, which
lead to a deficiency of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase that is required for
Page 1 of 5: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Metabolic Disorders – Nitisinone
Products Prior Authorization Policy
the breakdown of tyrosine. Symptoms usually appear in the first few months after
birth and include failure to thrive, diarrhea, vomiting, jaundice, cabbage-like odor,
and increased tendency to bleed. Diagnosis is most often via newborn screening
(i.e., elevated alpha-fetoprotein and succinylacetone); however, carrier genetic
testing and prenatal diagnosis by detection of succinylacetone in the amniotic fluid
are also possible. Treatment should be initiated immediately upon diagnosis with a
diet restricted in tyrosine and phenylalanine and with nitisinone, which blocks the
second step in the tyrosine degradation pathway.
Alkaptonuria
Alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, characterized by the
accumulation of homogentisic acid in the body.6,7 It is caused by mutations in the
homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase (HGD) gene, which leads to deficiency of the HGD
enzyme. This enzyme plays a role in the metabolism of tyrosine and converts
homogentisic acid (HGA) into malate and acetoacetate. In the absence of HGD, HGA
accumulates in the body. Excess HGA is excreted in the urine, which darkens upon
standing due to oxidation. HGA also deposits in connective tissues in a process called
ochronosis. Ochronosis results in the blueish-black pigmentation of tissues such as
cartilage and sclera. Over time, alkaptonuric ochronosis manifests with progressive
musculoskeletal conditions, such as arthritis, ankylosis, and intravertebral disc
calcification. Of note, pigmentation changes of the sclera do not affect vision. On
exam, the sclera may have brown or gray deposits. Other manifestations due to
pigment deposition include stone formation in various organs and valvular heart
disease. Diagnosis is generally made by detection of elevated levels of HGA in the
urine or molecular genetic testing confirming biallelic pathogenic variants in the HGD
gene.7 Treatment with nitisinone in patients maintained on a regular diet has
demonstrated an improvement in HGA levels8-11; of note, the pivotal study for Harliku
utilized Orfadin in its investigation.2
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of nitisinone
products. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
nitisinone products as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-
term efficacy, approval requires the agent to be prescribed by or in consultation with
a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Harliku™ (nitisinone tablets – Cycle)
• Orfadin® (nitisinone capsules and suspension – Sobi, generic
[capsules only])
• Nityr® (nitisinone tablets – Cycle)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
