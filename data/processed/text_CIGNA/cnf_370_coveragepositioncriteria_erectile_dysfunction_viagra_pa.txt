CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Sildenafil (Viagra, generic), a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, is indicated for the
treatment of erectile dysfunction.1
Sildenafil has been studied for other indications.
• Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. The European Association of Urology guidelines
(2022) note that phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors can be used in men with
moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms with or without erectile
dysfunction.9 The guidelines add that based on the results from a meta-analysis8,
younger men with lower body mass index and more severe lower urinary tract
symptoms benefit the most from phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.
• High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema. Published guidelines for the prevention of high-
altitude pulmonary edema recommend nifedipine as the preferred pharmacologic
treatment option .12 Other pharmacologic therapies include salmeterol, tadalafil,
sildenafil, dexamethasone, or acetazolamide.
• Prophylaxis after Radical Prostatectomy. Viagra given on a daily basis has been
used to improve the return of normal spontaneous erectile function, improve tissue
oxygenation, and prevent penile fibrosis after nerve-sparing radical
prostatectomy.10,11 It is better to initiate a penile rehabilitation program as soon as
possible after surgery in order to limit and prevent postoperative local
hypoxygenation and fibrosis.

Policy
• Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. Sildenafil tablets (Revatio®) are approved for
pulmonary arterial hypertension.2 Sildenafil (Viagra, generics) are available in 25
mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg tablets, and Revatio is available as 20 mg tablets. Viagra
has been used for this diagnosis.3,4 Doses of Viagra that were used in these reports
ranged from 25 mg twice daily to 100 mg five times daily. Patients will have usually
been started on Revatio 20 mg three times daily.
• Raynaud’s Phenomenon. There are studies which show sildenafil has been
beneficial in patients with Raynauds’s phenomenon.5,6 Guidelines from the European
League against Rheumatism (EULAR) on the treatment of systemic sclerosis (2023)
recommend considering dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), usually
oral nifedipine, for first-line therapy of Raynaud’s phenomenon in patients with
systemic sclerosis.7 Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors should also be considered in
such clinical scenarios.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of sildenafil. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with sildenafil as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, some approvals require
sildenafil to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
