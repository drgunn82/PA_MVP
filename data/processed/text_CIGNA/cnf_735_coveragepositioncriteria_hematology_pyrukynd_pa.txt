INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Pyrukynd, a pyruvate kinase activator, is indicated for the treatment of hemolytic
anemia due to pyruvate kinase deficiency in adults.1
It is recommended to discontinue Pyrukynd if no benefit has been observed by 24
weeks as evaluated by hemoglobin and hemolysis laboratory results and transfusion
requirements.
Disease Overview
Pyruvate kinase deficiency is a rare (three to nine cases per one million people),
autosomal recessive enzyme defect in red blood cells that is caused by mutations in
the pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cell (PKLR) gene.2,3 These alterations result
in a deficit of pyruvate kinase activity in red blood cells which leads to hemolytic
anemia of varying severity.2 Other complications include iron overload (and its
sequelae), bilirubin gallstones, pulmonary hypertension, thrombosis, and
extramedullary hematopoiesis. Commonly present are compound heterozygous
mutations in the gene encoding the L and R isozymes of PKLR with more than 300
mutations noted; most patients have at least on missense mutation. More notable
management strategies involve blood transfusions, splenectomy, and chelation
therapy.

POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Pyrukynd. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Pyrukynd as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Pyrukynd to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated.
Documentation: Documentation is required for use of Pyrukynd as noted in the
criteria as [documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not
limited to, chart notes, laboratory tests, claims records, and/or other information.
• Pyrukynd® (mitapivat tablets (Agios)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Hemolytic Anemia Due to Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency. Approve for the
duration noted below if the patient meets ONE of the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets ALL of the following
(i, ii, iii, and iv):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Patient meets BOTH of the following (a and b):
a) Presence of at least two variant/mutant alleles in the pyruvate kinase
liver and red blood cell (PKLR) gene [documentation required]; AND
b) At least one of the variant/mutant alleles was a missense variant
[documentation required]; AND
iii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):
a) Patient has a current hemoglobin level ≤ 10 g/dL; OR
b) Patient is currently receiving red blood cell transfusions regularly,
defined as at least six transfusions within the last year; AND
iv. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a hematologist; OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Pyrukynd. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
ALL of the following (i, ii, iii, and iv):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Patient meets BOTH of the following (a and b):
a) Presence of at least two variant/mutant alleles in the pyruvate kinase
liver and red blood cell (PKLR) gene [documentation required]; AND
b) At least one of the variant/mutant alleles was a missense variant
[documentation required]; AND
iii. According to the prescriber, the patient has experienced a benefit from
therapy based on ONE of the following (a, b, or c):
a) Increase in or maintenance of hemoglobin levels; OR

b) Improvement in or maintenance of hemolysis laboratory parameters;
OR
Note: Examples of laboratory parameters that are markers of hemolysis
include indirect bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, and haptoglobin.
c) Decrease in or maintenance of transfusion requirements; AND
iv. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a hematologist.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Pyrukynd® (mitapivat tablets (Agios)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Patient with Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency Homozygous for the c.1436G>A
(p.R479H) Variant/Mutation in the Pyruvate Kinase Liver and Red Blood
Cell (PKLR) Gene. Such patients were excluded from the pivotal studies
investigating Pyrukynd in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency because they
did not achieve a hemoglobin response in the dose-ranging study.1
2. Patient with Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency with Two Non-Missense
Variants/Mutations (without the presence of another missense
variant/mutation) in the Pyruvate Kinase Liver and Red Blood Cell (PKLR)
Gene. Such patients were excluded from the pivotal studies investigating
Pyrukynd because they did not achieve a hemoglobin response in the dose-
ranging study.1
