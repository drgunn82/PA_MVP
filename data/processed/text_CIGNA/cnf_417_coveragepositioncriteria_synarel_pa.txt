INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Synarel, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, is indicated for the
following uses:1
• Central precocious puberty, treatment in children of both sexes.
• Endometriosis management, including pain relief and reduction of
endometriotic lesions. Experience with Synarel for this indication is limited to
women ≥ 18 years of age treated for 6 months.
Guidelines
GnRH agonists are the standard of care for the treatment of central precocious
puberty.2-4 The European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and the Lawson
Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society convened a consensus conference to review the
use of GnRH agonists in pediatric patients with central precocious puberty (2009).2
The panel noted that the available GnRH agonists (including nafarelin) are effective
despite different routes of administration, dosing, and duration of action. In
addition, the various GnRH agonists are well-tolerated in children and adolescents.
An update by an International Consortium (2019) notes the lack of prospective
comparative studies to establish differences in efficacy (if any) among the various
GnRH agonists.3 Discontinuation of GnRH agonist therapy should be individualized,
based on the patient’s readiness for resumption of puberty, recent growth rates,
and shifts in height prediction.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) practice bulletin
on the management of endometriosis (2010, reaffirmed 2018) notes that empiric
treatment with a GnRH agonist is appropriate after an appropriate pretreatment
evaluation (to exclude other causes of chronic pelvic pain) and failure of initial
treatment with oral contraceptives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.5
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Synarel. All
approvals are provided for 1 year in duration unless otherwise noted below. In
cases where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days.
Automation: None.
• Synarel® (nafarelin acetate nasal solution – Pfizer)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Central Precocious Puberty. Approve for 1 year.
2. Endometriosis. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets BOTH of the
following (A and B):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) Patient has tried ONE of the following, unless contraindicated (i, ii, or iii):
i. A contraceptive; OR
Note: Examples of contraceptives include combination oral
contraceptives, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems [e.g.,
Mirena®, Liletta®]).
ii. An oral progesterone (e.g., norethindrone tablets); OR
iii. A depo-medroxyprogesterone injection.
Note: An exception to the requirement for a trial of the above therapies
can be made if the patient has previously used a gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH) agonist (e.g., Lupron Depot) or antagonist (e.g.,
Orilissa) for endometriosis.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Synarel® (nafarelin acetate nasal solution – Pfizer)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria
will be updated as new published data are available):
1. Peripheral Precocious Puberty (Also Known as Gonadotropin-Releasing
Hormone-Independent Precocious Puberty). Children with peripheral
precocious puberty do not respond to GnRH agonist therapy.2 Treatment is
directed at removing or blocking the production and/or response to the excess
sex steroids, depending on the cause (e.g., surgically removing human chorionic
gonadotropin-secreting tumors or using glucocorticoids to treat defects in
adrenal steroidogenesis [such as classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia]).
