INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Eohilia, a corticosteroid, is indicated for the treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)
for 12 weeks in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 11 years of age.1 Use of Eohilia has
not been shown to be safe and effective for the treatment of EoE for longer than 12 weeks.
Clinical Efficacy
In two pivotal trials of Eohilia, patients were required to have histologic evidence of EoE,
defined as ≥ 15 eosinophils per high-power field despite 6 to 8 weeks of treatment with a
high-dose proton pump inhibitor.2,3 Patients in both trials received 12 weeks of therapy with
Eohilia. There are no data to address the time frame at which another 12-week course of
Eohilia would be appropriate in patients who initially respond to treatment, but relapse
following discontinuation. However, an extension study enrolled patients who were
considered to be full responders to Eohilia in an initial 12-week trial and subsequently re-
randomized them to either continue Eohilia or switch to placebo.4 Patients who were
switched to placebo and then relapsed could reinitiate blinded Eohilia treatment at the next
study visit. Over the 36-week extension, seven patients receiving placebo relapsed and
reinitiated Eohilia therapy. Of these seven, one patient was an outlier and reinitiated
therapy at Week 8 due to an unscheduled endoscopy. The remaining patients relapsed and
reinitiated therapy with Eohilia between 4 and 7 months following the initial discontinuation
of Eohilia therapy.
Guidelines
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Gastroenterology – Eohilia Prior Authorization Policy
Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of EoE from the American College of
Gastroenterology (2025) confirm that the diagnosis of EoE should be based on the presence
esophageal dysfunction symptoms and ≥ 15 eosinophils per high-power field on esophageal
biopsy.5 Treatment with a proton pump inhibitor is recommended, as is treatment with
swallowed topical corticosteroids. A food elimination diet is recommended. However, it is
noted that patient preferences should be taken into account and that any decisions
regarding diet should be agreed upon between the patient and the provider.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Eohilia. All approvals
are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills required for
evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Eohilia as well as the monitoring required
for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires Eohilia to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Eohilia™ (budesonide oral suspension (Takeda)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for
FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Eosinophilic Esophagitis. Approve for 12 weeks, if the patient meets ALL of the
following (A, B, C, D, E and F):
A) Patient is ≥ 11 years of age; AND
B) Patient has a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis as confirmed by an endoscopic
biopsy demonstrating ≥ 15 intraepithelial eosinophils per high-power field; AND
C) Patient meets ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Patient has received at least 8 weeks of therapy with a proton pump inhibitor; OR
Note: Treatment with a proton pump inhibitor currently or at any time in the
past would count toward this requirement.
ii. According to the prescriber, the patient has severe disease with esophageal
stricture; AND
D) Patient meets ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Patient has tried dietary modifications to manage eosinophilic esophagitis; OR
ii. The prescriber has determined that the patient is not an appropriate candidate
for dietary modifications; AND
Note: Examples of dietary modifications to treat eosinophilic esophagitis include
an elemental diet or an elimination diet.
E) Patients meets ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Patient is currently receiving a course of Eohilia, and additional medication is
needed to complete a 12-week course of treatment; OR
Note: The maximum recommended treatment is for 12 weeks. For a patient who
has started therapy but has not completed 12 weeks, approve the remaining
number of weeks for the patient to receive a total of 12 weeks.
ii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):
a. Patient has not been treated with Eohilia within the previous 6 months; OR
b. According to the prescriber, the patient is experiencing recurrent worsening
