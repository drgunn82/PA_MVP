INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
The products targeted in this policy are continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
systems. Freestyle Libre and Freestyle Libre 2 are considered intermittently scanned
CGM (isCGM) systems, whereas the other devices are considered real-time CGM
(rtCGM) systems. Of note, throughout the policy, the term CGM “system” refers to
all applicable components, including sensor, transmitter/reader, and receiver.
Most CGM systems are designated as integrated CGM (iCGM), a higher standard set
by the FDA for integration with other digitally connected devices.1 Dexcom G6,
Dexcom G7, Eversense E3, FreeStyle Libre 2 Plus, FreeStyle Libre 3 Plus, and

Authorization Policy
Guardian are FDA-approved for use with automated insulin delivery (AID) systems.
Dexcom G6, Dexcom G7, and FreeStyle Libre 2 are approved for use with connected
insulin pens.
Guidelines
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care (2025) comment on the
role of rtCGM and isCGM in the management of diabetes.1 CGM is recommended for
patients with diabetes who are on any type of insulin therapy (level of evidence A for
rtCGM, level of evidence C for youth, and level of evidence B for adults). In all cases,
it is noted that the choice of device should be made based on the individual’s
circumstances, preferences, and needs. In adults with type 2 diabetes treated with
glucose lowering medications other than insulin, CGM may be considered to achieve
and maintain glycemic goals (level of evidence B). In pregnant patients, CGM can
help to achieve glycemic goals for individuals with type 1 diabetes and may be
beneficial for other types of diabetes in pregnancy.
When used in addition to blood glucose monitoring in diabetes and pregnancy, CGM
can help to achieve glycemic goals (level of evidence A) and hemoglobin A goal
1c
(level of evidence B) in patients with type 1 diabetes and pregnancy and may be
beneficial for other types of diabetes in pregnancy (level of evidence E).1 CGM is
recommended in pregnancies associated with type 1 diabetes (level of evidence A)
and when used in addition to blood glucose monitoring, achieving traditional pre- and
post-prandial goals, rtCGM can reduce the risk of large for gestational age infants
and neonatal hypoglycemia in pregnant patients with type 1 diabetes (level of
evidence A). There are insufficient data to support the use of CGM in all pregnant
patients with type 2 diabetes or gestational diabetes. The decision to use CGM in such
patients should be individualized based on treatment regimen, circumstances,
preferences, and needs. In pregnant patients with pre-existing type 1 diabetes,
insulin should be used (level of evidence A); in pregnant patients with pre-existing
type 2 diabetes, insulin is preferred for glycemic management (level of evidence B).
CGM is beneficial and recommended for individuals at high risk of hypoglycemia (level
of evidence A).1 Patients considered to be at high risk of hypoglycemia are a subset
of patients at risk for hypoglycemia who either have a major hypoglycemia risk factor
or have multiple other risk factors (determined by the health care professional). One
of the major risk factors identified in the Standards of Care is a recent (within the
past 3 to 6 months) level 2 or level 3 hypoglycemia event. Level 2 hypoglycemia is
defined as a glucose value < 54 mg/dL. Level 3 hypoglycemia is defined as a severe
event characterized by altered mental and/or physical status requiring assistance for
treatment of hypoglycemia, irrespective of glucose level.
The American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) clinical practice guidelines
regarding use of advanced technology in the management of persons with diabetes
mellitus (2021) discuss CGM.2 CGM is strongly recommended for all persons with
diabetes treated with intensive insulin therapy, defined as three or more injections
of insulin per day or the use of an insulin pump (Grade A; high strength of evidence).
It is noted that CGM may be recommended for individuals with type 2 diabetes who
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Diabetes – Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems Prior
Authorization Policy
are treated with less intensive insulin therapy; however, the strength of evidence is
lower (Grade B; intermediate strength of evidence).
The AACE consensus statement for type 2 diabetes (2023) notes in patients with type
2 diabetes on basal insulin, clinical trials have shown that CGM is associated with
increased time in range, improved hemoglobin A , and decreased hypoglycemia,
1c
including severe hypoglycemic events.3
