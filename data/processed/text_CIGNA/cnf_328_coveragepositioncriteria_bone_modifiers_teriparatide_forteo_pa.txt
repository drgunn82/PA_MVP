INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT

COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Teriparatide products, which are parathyroid hormone (PTH 1-34) analogs, are indicated for
the following uses:1-5
• Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (treatment), in men and women at high
risk for fracture associated with sustained systemic glucocorticoid therapy (daily
dosage equivalent to 5 mg or greater of prednisone).
• Osteoporosis, treatment of postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture.
• Osteoporosis, to increase bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal
osteoporosis at high risk for fracture.
In general, for all indications, patients at high risk for fracture are defined as those with a
history of osteoporotic fractures, have multiple risk factors for fracture, or have failed or are
intolerant to other osteoporosis therapy.1-5
Page 1 of 10 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Bone Modifiers – Teriparatide Products Prior
Authorization Policy
Guidelines
Teriparatide is addressed in various clinical guidelines.6-9
• Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis: The American College of Rheumatology
has guidelines for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced
osteoporosis (2022).6 In various clinical scenarios, teriparatide is recommended
after trial of other agents (e.g., oral bisphosphonates, intravenous bisphosphonates).
• Postmenopausal Osteoporosis: Teriparatide products are mentioned in guidelines
for postmenopausal osteoporosis by the Endocrine Society (2019)7 and the American
Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American College of Endocrinology
(2020)8. Teriparatide is one of several agents cited as an alternative for patients at
very high risk for fractures or among those who cannot tolerate oral therapy. The
Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation clinician guide for the prevention and
treatment of osteoporosis (2022) cite robust reductions in vertebral and non-
vertebral fractures with teriparatide.9
Safety
An increased incidence of osteosarcoma was noted in male and female rats who received
teriparatide.1 Osteosarcoma has been reported in patients treated with teriparatide in the
post-marketing setting, however, an increased risk of osteosarcoma has not been observed
in observational studies involving humans. There are limited data evaluating the risk of
osteosarcoma beyond 2 years of teriparatide use. Avoid use of teriparatide in patients with
a baseline risk of osteosarcoma. Use of teriparatide for more than 2 years during a
patient’s lifetime should only be considered if a patient remains at or has returned to having
a high risk for fracture.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of teriparatide
products. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. For the indication of
hypoparathyroidism, because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis
of patients treated with teriparatide as well as monitoring for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, approval requires teriparatide to be prescribed by or in consultation with a
physician who specializes in the condition being treated. In the approval indication, as
appropriate, an asterisk (*) is noted next to the specified gender. In this context, the
specified gender is defined as follows: men are defined as individuals with the biological
traits of a man, regardless of the individual’s gender identity or gender expression.

HISTORY
Type of Summary of Changes Review
Revision Date
Annual To comply with standard wording, the phrase “as determined by the 09/27/2023
Revision prescriber” was replaced with “according to the prescriber”. In addition,
the following changes were made:
Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis –Treatment: The exception
that the patient has had an osteoporotic fracture or a fragility fracture
while receiving oral bisphosphonate therapy was removed. Instead, this
exception was incorporated into a Note that lists osteoporotic fracture or a
fragility fracture as an example of inadequate efficacy or significant
intolerance to a trial of an oral bisphosphonate or an oral bisphosphonate-
containing product. Femoral fracture was removed as an example of
significant intolerance to an oral bisphosphonate.
Osteoporosis Treatment (to Increase Bone Mass) for Men with
Primary or Hypogonadal Osteoporosis: The indication was revised to
as stated to follow standard formatting. The exception that the patient
has had an osteoporotic fracture or a fragility fracture while receiving oral
bisphosphonate therapy was removed. Instead, this exception was
incorporated into a Note that lists osteoporotic fracture or a fragility
fracture as an example of inadequate efficacy or significant intolerance to
a trial of an oral bisphosphonate or an oral bisphosphonate-containing

product. Femoral fracture was removed as an example of significant
intolerance to an oral bisphosphonate.
Osteoporosis Treatment for a Postmenopausal Patient: The
exception that the patient has had an osteoporotic fracture or a fragility
fracture while receiving oral bisphosphonate therapy was removed.
Instead, this exception was incorporated into a Note that lists osteoporotic
fracture or a fragility fracture as an example of inadequate efficacy or
significant intolerance to a trial of an oral bisphosphonate or an oral
bisphosphonate-containing product. Femoral fracture was removed as an
example of significant intolerance to an oral bisphosphonate.
Update 11/27/2023: No criteria changes. It was added that multiple generics for NA
Forteo are available.
Annual Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis – Treatment: The exception to the 10/23/2024
Revision requirement for a trial of a bisphosphonate due to severe renal impairment
or chronic kidney disease were revised. The criteria are now combined
and the phrase “according to the prescriber” was added.
Osteoporosis Treatment (to Increase Bone Mass) for Men with
Primary or Hypogonadal Osteoporosis: The exception to the
requirement for a trial of a bisphosphonate due to severe renal impairment
or chronic kidney disease were revised. The criteria are now combined
and the phrase “according to the prescriber” was added.
Osteoporosis Treatment for a Postmenopausal Patient: The
exception to the requirement for a trial of a bisphosphonate due to severe
renal impairment or chronic kidney disease were revised. The criteria are
now combined and the phrase “according to the prescriber” was added.
Hypoparathyroidism: The exception provided that Natpara is not
available was removed. An exception was added if the patient has tried
Yorvipath (palopegteriparatide subcutaneous injection).
Selected Chronic Hypoparathyroidism: The indication was revised from 10/30/2024
Revision “Hypoparathyroidism” to as stated. A nephrologist was added as a
physician type that counts toward the specialist requirement.
Selected Chronic Hypoparathyroidism: This condition of approval was removed. 4/30/2025
Revision
Selected Bonsity was added to the policy with the same criteria as existing 07/02/2025
Revision teriparatide products.
