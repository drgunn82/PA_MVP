CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Tadalafil (Cialis, generic), a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitor, is indicated
for the following uses1:
• Benign prostatic hyperplasia.
• Erectile dysfunction.
• Erectile dysfunction and the signs and symptoms of benign
prostatic hyperplasia.
Tadalafil has been studied for other indications:
• High-Altitude pulmonary edema. Published guidelines for the prevention
of high-altitude pulmonary edema recommend nifedipine as the preferred
pharmacologic treatment option.11 Other pharmacologic therapies include
salmeterol, sildenafil, dexamethasone, or acetazolamide.
• Prophylaxis after radical prostatectomy. Multiple studies have evaluated
the efficacy of tadalafil for prophylaxis after radical prostatectomy.5-7
• Pulmonary arterial hypertension. Adcirca® (tadalafil tablets, generic)
contain the same active ingredient as tadalafil (Cialis, generic) and is
indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Tadalafil
(Cialis, generic) is available in 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg tablets.

Policy
Adcirca is available as a 20 mg tablet. Tadalafil (Cialis, generic) has been used
in multiple studies for pulmonary arterial hypertension.8-10
• Raynaud’s phenomenon. There are studies which show tadalafil has been
beneficial in patients with Raynaud’s phenomenon.2,3 Guidelines from the
European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) on the treatment of systemic
sclerosis (2023) recommend considering dihydropyridine calcium channel
blockers (CCBs), usually oral nifedipine, for first-line therapy of Raynaud’s
phenomenon in patients with systemic sclerosis.4 Phosphodiesterase type 5
inhibitors should also be considered in such clinical scenarios.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of tadalafil. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with tadalafil as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, some approvals
