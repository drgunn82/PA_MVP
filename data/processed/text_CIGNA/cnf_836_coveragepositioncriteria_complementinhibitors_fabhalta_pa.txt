CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Fabhalta, a Factor B inhibitor, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Complement 3 glomerulopathy (C3G), to reduce proteinuria in adults.
• Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), in adults.
• Primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), for the reduction of
proteinuria in adults at risk of rapid disease progression, generally a urine
protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥1.5 g/g.
For the IgAN indication, Fabhalta was approved under accelerated approval based on
reduction of proteinuria.1 It has not been established whether Fabhalta slows kidney
function decline in patients with IgAN. Continued approval for this indication may be
contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory
clinical trial.

Policy
Fabhalta has a Boxed Warning about serious meningococcal infections.1 Fabhalta is
only available through a restricted access program, Fabhalta Risk Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategy (REMS).
Disease Overview
C3G
C3G, an ultra-rare complement-mediated kidney disease, is chronic and slowly
progressive.2,3 The prevalence of C3G is challenging to estimate accurately; registry
data suggest that incidence and prevalence are approximately 1 to 3 cases per million
and 5 cases per million, respectively in the US.2 C3G results from deregulation and
consequently overactivation of the alternative pathway of the complement system,
which allows the complement cascade to progress and activate all effector levels.2,3
In addition, deregulated complement results in deposition of C3b on target surfaces
of the glomerulus. Urine analysis is typically the first step in diagnosis and typically
shows proteinuria and hematuria. Renal biopsy is essential for diagnosis;
histopathologic features of C3G are characterized by C3 deposits, absence or minimal
immunoglobulin deposits within the glomeruli, evidence of glomerular inflammation,
and mesangial cell proliferation. There are no approved disease-specific therapy for
C3G. Standard of care includes supportive care, which includes blood pressure control
with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers
to reduce proteinuria and slow down kidney damage. Immunosuppressants such as
corticosteroids, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab are
typically used to treat moderate to severe disease. Immunosuppressives may be used
to reduce the production of autoantibodies and to reduce the inflammatory response.
Some patients may be treated with plasma exchange or plasmapheresis, which are
used to replace the defective complement proteins and to remove autoantibodies and
other forms of debris.
PNH
PNH is a rare, genetic disorder of hematopoietic stem cells.4,5 The mutation in the
X-linked gene phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) results in a deficiency in the
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) protein, which is responsible for anchoring other
protein moieties to the surface of the erythrocytes. Loss of anchoring of these
proteins causes cells to hemolyze and leads to complications such as hemolytic
anemia, thrombosis, and peripheral blood cytopenias. PNH is a clinical diagnosis that
should be confirmed with peripheral blood flow cytometry to detect the absence or
severe deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins on at least two lineages.4.6 Prior to the
availability of complement inhibitors, only supportive care to manage the cytopenias
and control thrombotic risk were available. Supportive measures include platelet
transfusion, immunosuppressive therapy for patients with bone marrow failure, use
of erythropoietin for anemias, and aggressive anticoagulation.
IgAN
IgAN is the most common primary glomerular disease in the world and it is the
leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure.7 The disease is
slowly progressive; approximately 25% to 30% of patients develop kidney failure
within 20 to 25 years of presentation. The management of IgAN is focused on
supportive care to slow the rate of disease progression. IgAN is characterized by a
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Complement Inhibitors – Fabhalta Prior Authorization Policy
single histopathologic criterion of predominant or co-dominant IgA deposits on kidney
biopsy; however, it is well recognized that the disease exhibits heterogeneity in
clinical and pathological features. Hypertension and proteinuria are major risk factors
for the progression of CKD. Guidelines from Kidney Diseases: Improving Global
Outcomes (KDIGO) note that proteinuria reduction to < 0.5 g/day, a surrogate
marker of improved kidney outcomes in IgAN, is a reasonable target.
Clinical Efficacy
C3G
The efficacy of Fabhalta for the treatment of C3G was studied in a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study.1 All patients were ≥ 18 years of age with
biopsy-confirmed native kidney C3G with a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR)
≥ 1.0 g/g and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.
Patients were randomized to receive either Fabhalta 200 mg twice daily (BID) or
placebo for 6 months, followed by a 6-month open-label treatment period in which
all patients received Fabhalta. All patients were on a maximally recommended or
tolerated dose of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin
receptor blocker (ARB) for ≥ 90 days.8 In addition, patients could be receiving other
therapies (e.g., corticosteroid and/or mycophenolate mofetil) at baseline if they were
on stable doses for 90 days prior to randomization and throughout the study.1 The
primary efficacy endpoint was the log-transformed ratio to baseline in UPCR (sampled
from a 24-hour urine collection) at 6 months.
At Month 6, the geometric mean UPCR ratio relative to baseline was 0.70 (95%
confidence interval [CI]: 0.57, 0.85) for the Fabhalta group and 1.08 (95% CI: 0.88,
1.31) for the placebo group, resulting in a 35% reduction in the 24-hour UPCR from
baseline in the Fabhalta group compared with placebo (P = 0.0028).1 At 6 months,
compared with patients in the placebo group, patients treated with Fabhalta had a 7-
fold higher odds (P = 0.0166) of achieving a composite renal endpoint, defined as a
≥ 50% reduction in 24-hour UPCR compared to baseline and stable or improved eGFR
compared to baseline (≤ 15% reduction in eGFR). There was no difference between
the groups in the proportion of patients with stable or improved eGFR compared to
baseline at 6 months; 90% in the Fabhalta group vs. 89% in the placebo group;
however, a greater proportion of patients in the Fabhalta group achieved a ≥ 50%
reduction in 24-hour UPCR compared to baseline (30% vs. 6%, respectively).
IgAN
The efficacy of Fabhalta was evaluated in one Phase 3, pivotal, 24-month trial in
patients ≥ 18 years of age with IgAN.1,9 Eligible patients had biopsy-proven IgAN,
eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, and a UPCR ≥ 1.0 g/g on a stable dose of maximally-
tolerated renin-angiotensin system inhibitor for 3 months with or without a stable
dose of a sodium-glucose cotransporters 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. Patients were
randomized to Fabhalta 200 mg BID or placebo for 24 months while remaining on
supportive care. Fabhalta resulted in a statistically and clinically meaningful reduction
in proteinuria compared to placebo. Interim efficacy is reported at Month 9.
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in the 24-hour UPCR
(based on 24-hour urine sample) at Month 9.1,9 The primary analysis was based on
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Complement Inhibitors – Fabhalta Prior Authorization Policy
an interim data cutoff of August 15, 2023. At Month 9, the primary endpoint was
significantly greater with Fabhalta vs. placebo in the interim analysis set (comprised
of the first 250 patients randomized in the study); the geometric least squares mean
percent change in UPCR from baseline was -44% vs. -9%, respectively. This resulted
in a statistically significant relative reduction from baseline in UPCR for the Fabhalta
vs. placebo group (geometric mean ratio 0.617; 95% CI: 0.514, 0.740; P < 0.001),
corresponding to a 38% relative reduction with Fabhalta. For Fabhalta, the UPCR
changed from 1.9 g/g at baseline to 1.0 g/g at Month 9; for placebo, the change was
from 2.0 g/g at baseline to 1.7 g/g at Month 9.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Fabhalta. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Fabhalta as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Fabhalta to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
