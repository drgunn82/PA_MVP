INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
The fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleotide analog
NS5B polymerase inhibitor, and velpatasvir, an HCV NS5A inhibitor, is indicated for
the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1 through 6 infection in patients ≥ 3 years
of age.1 In patients with decompensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh B or C),
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is administered with weight-based ribavirin. The FDA-
approved duration of therapy with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is 12 weeks for all patients.
Guidelines
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society
of America (AASLD/IDSA) provide recommendations for testing, monitoring, and
treating HCV (December 19, 2023).2 Instances in which the guidelines provide
recommendations for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir outside of the FDA-approved indications
are outlined below.
With the availability of pangenotypic HCV treatment regimens, HCV genotyping is no
longer required prior to treatment initiation for all individuals. Pretreatment
genotyping is still recommended in patients with cirrhosis and/or past unsuccessful
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hepatitis C – Epclusa Prior Authorization Policy
HCV treatment, because treatment regimens may differ by genotype. However, for
treatment-naïve patients without cirrhosis, although genotyping may impact the
preferred treatment approach, it is not required if a pangenotypic regimen is used.
The recommendations provide a simplified treatment algorithm for treatment-naïve
adults where genotyping is not required.2 Treatment-naïve adults without cirrhosis
are eligible for simplified treatment if they do not have hepatitis B virus (not hepatitis
B serum antigen [HBsAg] positive), are not pregnant, do not have hepatocellular
carcinoma, and have not had a liver transplantation. In treatment-naïve adults
without cirrhosis, the recommended regimens are Mavyret® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
tablets) for 8 weeks or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks. Treatment-naïve adults
with compensated cirrhosis are also eligible for simplified treatment; however,
recommendations are genotype specific. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, the
recommended regimen in patients with genotype 1 through 6 is Mavyret for 8 weeks;
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks is recommended in patients with genotype 1, 2,
4, 5, or 6 (patients with genotype 3 require baseline NS5A resistance-associated
substitution testing. Those without Y93H can be treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir
for 12 weeks).
In patients with decompensated cirrhosis, the guidelines offer a recommendation for
patients who are ribavirin-ineligible to treat with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 24
weeks.2 (Note: sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is FDA-approved in this setting in combination
with ribavirin for 12 weeks for adult and pediatric patients). In pediatric patients
with any genotype, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir with weight-based ribavirin is
recommended in patients with prior exposure to an interferon-based regimen (±
ribavirin) and/or sofosbuvir but no exposure to NS3/4A or NS5A protease inhibitors,
with decompensated cirrhosis.
Although Vosevi® (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir tablets) is recommended in
most instances for adults with no cirrhosis or compensated cirrhosis who have failed
treatment with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is
recommended in adults (genotypes 1 through 6) with decompensated cirrhosis who
have failed therapy with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. In this setting,
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir is recommended for 24 weeks in combination with ribavirin.
Data are limited to one Phase II study where sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was studied in
patients with genotype 1, 2, and 3 who did not respond to velpatasvir-containing
regimens including sofosbuvir/velpatasvir and Vosevi.2,6 Retreatment with
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir + ribavirin for 24 weeks yielded high overall response rates
(sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment [SVR12] 91% [n = 63/69]).
Among patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV, 97% of patients (n = 36/37) achieved
SVR12. In patients with genotype 2 chronic HCV, SVR12 was attained in 95% of
patients (n = 13/14) and in patients with genotype 3 chronic HCV, SVR12 was
attained in 78% of patients (n = 14/18). Baseline NS5A resistance associated
substitutions did not appear to impact SVR rates. No breakdown of the proportion of
patients with decompensated cirrhosis was provided in the study.
POLICY STATEMENT
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hepatitis C – Epclusa Prior Authorization Policy
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with sofosbuvir/velpatasvir as well as the monitoring required for adverse
events and efficacy, approval requires sofosbuvir/velpatasvir to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
