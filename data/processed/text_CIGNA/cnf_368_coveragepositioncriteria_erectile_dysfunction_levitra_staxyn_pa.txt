INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Vardenafil tablets (Levitra, generic) and vardenafil orally disintegrating tablets (Staxyn,
generic), phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, are indicated for the treatment of erectile
dysfunction.1,2
Vardenafil has been studied for other indications:
• Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. Vardenafil has been studied in benign prostatic
hyperplasia.5,6 The European Association of Urology guidelines (2022) note that
phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors can be used in men with moderate-to-severe
lower urinary tract symptoms with or without erectile dysfunction.7 The guidelines
add that based on the results from a meta-analysis8, younger men with lower body
mass index and more severe lower urinary tract symptoms benefit the most from
treatment with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors.
• Prophylaxis after Radical Prostatectomy. Vardenafil was studied in men
following bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.9
• Raynaud’s Phenomenon. Vardenafil has been studied in patients with Raynaud’s
phenomenon.3,4 Vardenafil improved digital blood flow and decreased the number of
Raynaud’s attacks. Guidelines from the European League against Rheumatism
(EULAR) on the treatment of systemic sclerosis (2023) recommend considering
dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs), usually oral nifedipine, for first-line

therapy of Raynaud’s phenomenon in patients with systemic sclerosis.10
Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors should also be considered in such clinical
scenarios.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of vardenafil tablets
and vardenafil orally disintegrating tablets. All approvals are provided for the duration noted
below. Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with vardenafil as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, some approvals require vardenafil to be prescribed by or in consultation with a
physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Levitra® (vardenafil tablets - GlaxoSmithKline, generic)
• Staxyn™ (vardenafil orally disintegrating tablet - GlaxoSmithKline, generic)

FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication

Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
2. Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ONE of the
following (A or B):
Note: For men with erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia, use criterion
1 above.
A) Patient has tried an alpha-1 (α1) blocker; OR

and alfuzosin.
B) Patient has tried a 5α-reductase inhibitor.
Note: Examples of 5α-reductase inhibitor includes finasteride and dutasteride.
3. Prophylaxis After Radical Prostatectomy (Early Penile Rehabilitation). Approve
for 1 year if the patient meets BOTH of the following (A and B):
A) Patient had a radical prostatectomy within the previous 12 months; AND
B) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a urologist.
4. Raynaud’s Phenomenon. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ONE of the following
(A or B):
A) Patient has tried at least one calcium channel blocker; OR
Note: Examples of calcium channel blockers include amlodipine, felodipine, and
nifedipine.
B) According to the prescriber, use of a calcium channel blocker is contraindicated.
Note: Examples of reasons a patient cannot take a calcium channel blocker include
right heart failure and decreased cardiac output.
