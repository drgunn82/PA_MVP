CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Hemlibra, a bispecific Factor IXa- and Factor X-directed antibody, is indicated for
hemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency) with or without factor VIII inhibitors
for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in
adults and pediatric patients ages newborn and older.1
Hemlibra is recommended to be given as a loading dose by subcutaneous injection
once weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose given either once
weekly, once every 2 weeks, or once every 4 weeks.1 Discontinue prophylactic use
of bypassing medications the day before starting Hemlibra. The prophylactic use of
Factor VIII products may be continued during the first week of Hemlibra prophylaxis.
If appropriate, a patient or caregiver may self-inject Hemlibra. Self-administration
is not recommended for children < 7 years of age.

Disease Overview
Hemophilia A is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by a dysfunction or deficiency in
Factor VIII.2-5 Because hemophilia is an X-linked condition, males are primary
impacted. In the US, the incidence of hemophilia A in males is 1:5,000 with an
estimated 26,400 people in the US living with hemophilia A. Patients who have
hemophilia A are not able to properly form clots in the blood and may bleed for a
longer time than normal following injury or surgery. Patients may also experience
spontaneous bleeding in muscles, joints, and organs. Bleeds may be life-threatening.
A main morbidity is hemophilic arthropathy, which limits mobility. The condition is
characterized by bleeding in joints, either spontaneously or in a provoked joint by
trauma. The disease can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on reduced
Factor VIII; approximately 50% of patients with hemophilia A have severe disease.
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) to factor products is a challenging
complication as it causes Factor VIII therapies to be ineffective, which increases
bleeding frequency and severity. Inhibitors develop in around 30% and 10% of
patients with severe hemophilia A and hemophilia B, respectively.
Guidelines
Various guidelines discuss Hemlibra.6-9
• National Bleeding Disorders Foundation: Two documents from the
National Bleeding Disorders Foundation’s Medical and Scientific Advisory
Council (MASAC) provide recommendations regarding Hemlibra.6,7 In general,
Hemlibra has been shown to prevent or reduce the occurrence of bleeding in
patients with hemophilia A in adults, adolescents, children and infants, both
with and without inhibitors.6 Continuation of Factor VIII prophylaxis during
the week after initiation of Hemlibra is a reasonable approach.7 However,
because Hemlibra steady-state levels are not achieved until after four weekly
doses, it may be reasonable to continue Factor VIII prophylaxis in selected
patients based on bleeding history, as well as physical history, until they are
ready to initiate maintenance dosing. Factor VIII products may be used for
breakthrough bleeding events.
• World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH): Guidelines from the WFH
regarding hemophilia (2020) feature Hemlibra in a variety of clinical
scenarios.8 It is noted that the subcutaneous administration permits patients
to initiate prophylaxis at a very young age. Other key benefits include its long
half-life, high efficacy in bleed prevention, and reduction in bleeding episodes
in patients with or without inhibitors.
• International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis: In 2024, the
International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis published a practice
guideline for the treatment of congenital hemophilia A and B.9 There are many
recommendations. In patients with severe or moderately severe hemophilia A
or B without inhibitors, prophylaxis is recommended over episodic treatment
of bleeding events (strong recommendation based on moderate-certainty
evidence). For hemophilia A for this population, prophylaxis with Hemlibra or
Factor VIII concentrates is recommended (conditional recommendation based
on very low certainty-evidence). In patients with severe hemophilia A with
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hemophilia – Non-Factor Routine Prophylaxis Products (
Hemlibra Prior Authorization Policy
inhibitors, prophylaxis with Hemlibra is recommended over bypassing agents
(conditional recommendation based on very low-certainty evidence).
Safety
Hemlibra has a Boxed Warning regarding thrombotic microangiopathy and
thromboembolism.1 Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy and thrombotic events
were reported when on average a cumulative amount of > 100 U/kg/24 hours of
activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) was given for 24 hours or more
to patients receiving Hemlibra prophylaxis. Monitor for the development of
thrombotic microangiopathy and thrombotic events when aPCC is given. Discontinue
prophylactic use of bypassing agents the day before starting Hemlibra.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Hemlibra. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Hemlibra as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Hemlibra to be prescribed by or in consultation with a hemophilia specialist.

Revision
Annual “Non-Factor Routine Prophylaxis Products” was added to the title of 06/11/2025
Revision the Policy. In addition, the following changes were made:
Hemophilia A with Factor VIII Inhibitors: In Initial Therapy,
requirements were added that Factor VIII inhibitor titer testing has
been performed within the past 30 days, and that the patient has a
positive test for Factor VIII inhibitors of ≥ 0.6 Bethesda units/mL. The
following requirements were deleted: the patient has had a positive
Factor VIII inhibitor titer > than 5 Bethesda Units or that the patient
has had a positive Factor VIII inhibitor titer ≤ to 5 Bethesda units and
either has had an anamnestic response (current or past) to Factor VIII
product dosing or that the patient experienced an inadequate clinical
response (current or past) to increased Factor VIII product dosing.
The requirement that the prescriber attests that if the patient is
currently receiving a bypassing agent for prophylaxis, that the
bypassing agent therapy will be discontinued the day prior to initiation
of Hemlibra was changed to “According to the prescriber, prophylactic
use of bypassing agents will be discontinued”. The requirement that
prophylactic use of bypassing agents will not occur while using
Hemlibra was removed. The requirement that the prescriber attests
that the patient will not be undergoing immune tolerance induction
therapy while receiving Hemlibra was changed to “The patient is not
undergoing immune tolerance induction therapy”. The requirement
that the prescriber attests the following regarding Factor VIII product
was deleted: 1) that if the patient is currently receiving a Factor VIII
product for prophylactic use, the Factor VIII product will be
discontinued within the initial 4-week loading dose period with
Hemlibra and 2) prophylactic use of Factor VIII products will not occur
while using Hemlibra; the related Note was also removed. For a
Patient Currently Receiving Hemlibra, the requirement that the
“Prescriber attests that prophylactic use of bypassing agents will not
occur while using Hemlibra” was changed to “According to the
prescriber prophylactic use of bypassing agents will not occur while
receiving Hemlibra”. The requirement that the “prescriber attests that
the patient will not be undergoing immune tolerance induction while
receiving Hemlibra” was changed to “Patient is not undergoing
immune tolerance induction therapy”. The requirement was deleted
that the prescriber attests that prophylactic use of Factor VIII products
will not occur while using Hemlibra was deleted; the related Note was
also removed. In the Note regarding examples of a beneficial
response, the phrase “to therapy” was added and “spontaneous
bleeding events” was changed to “spontaneous bleeds.”
Hemophilia A without Factor VIII Inhibitors: In Initial Therapy,
the requirement that the patient either had Factor VIII inhibitor titer
testing performed within the past 30 days and the patient does not
have a positive test for Factor VIII inhibitors of ≥ 1.0 Bethesda
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hemophilia – Non-Factor Routine Prophylaxis Products (

units/mL, or the patient has not received Factor VIII therapy in the
past was added. The following requirement was deleted: that the
patient either has severe to moderate severe disease as defined by
pretreatment Factor VIII levels ≤ 2% of normal or that the patient has
moderate to mild disease as defined by pretreatment Factor VIII levels
> 2% to < 40% of normal and meets one of the following: 1) patient
has experienced a severe, traumatic, or spontaneous bleeding episode
as determined by the prescriber, 2) patient has hemophilia related
joint damage, has experienced a joint bleed, or has a specific joint
that is subject to recurrent bleeding (presence of a target joint), or 3)
patient is in a perioperative situation and/or has an additional clinical
scenario regarding bleeding/bleeding risk in which the prescriber
determines the use of Hemlibra is warranted. Also, Notes related to
these requirements were deleted. The requirement that the prescriber
attests that prophylactic use of bypassing agents will not occur while
using Hemlibra (along with the related Note) was removed. The
requirement regarding use of Factor VIII products was changed to
state that “according to the prescriber, prophylactic use of Factor VIII

week loading dose period with Hemlibra and that prophylactic use of
Factor VIII products will not occur while using Hemlibra. For a Patient
Currently Receiving Hemlibra, the requirement that the prescriber
attests that prophylactic use of bypassing agents will not occur while
using Hemlibra was deleted, along with the related Note. Regarding
prophylactic use of Factor VIII products, the phrase “Prescriber
attests” was changed to “According to the prescriber” and the word
“using” was changed to “receiving”. In the Note regarding examples
of a beneficial response, the phrase “to therapy” was added and
“spontaneous bleeding events” was changed to “spontaneous bleeds.”
