INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Sucraid, an enzyme replacement therapy, is indicated for the treatment of sucrase
deficiency, which is part of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID).1
Disease Overview
CSID is an autosomal recessive intestinal disorder characterized by reduced or absent
activity of the sucrase-isomaltase complex.2,3 These enzymes are responsible for the
hydrolysis of complex sugars and starches into simple sugars which are absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract. With absent or diminished enzyme activity, complex
sugars and starches accumulate in the small intestine and lead to disease
manifestations.2 Symptoms include osmotic diarrhea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal
pain, and steatorrhea.2,3 Patients can occasionally experience dehydration, failure to
thrive, developmental delay, and muscular hypotonia.2 The diagnosis of CSID can
be established by testing small intestine biopsy specimens for reduced or absent

enzyme activity; this is considered the gold standard. Additionally, genetic testing
to identify a mutation in the sucrase-isomaltase gene may also confirm diagnosis.3-5
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Sucraid. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Sucraid as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Sucraid to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.

is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Congenital Sucrase-Isomaltase Deficiency. Approve for 1 year if the patient
meets ALL of the following (A, B, and C):
A) The diagnosis is established by ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Patient has endoscopic biopsy of the small bowel with disaccharidase levels
consistent with congenital sucrose-isomaltase deficiency as evidenced by
ALL of the following (a, b, c, and d):
a) Decreased (usually absent) sucrase level (normal reference: > 25 U/g
protein); AND
b) Decreased or normal isomaltase (palatinase) level [normal reference:
> 5 U/g protein]; AND
c) Decreased maltase level (normal reference: > 100 U/g protein); AND
d) Decreased or normal lactase level (normal reference: > 15 U/g protein);
OR
ii. Patient has a molecular genetic test demonstrating homozygous or
compound heterozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic sucrase-
isomaltase gene variant; AND
B) Prior to starting therapy with Sucraid, patient had symptomatic congenital
sucrose-isomaltase deficiency (e.g., diarrhea, bloating, abdominal cramping);
AND
C) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a geneticist,
gastroenterologist, a metabolic disorder sub-specialist, or a physician who
specializes in the treatment of congenital diarrheal disorders.
