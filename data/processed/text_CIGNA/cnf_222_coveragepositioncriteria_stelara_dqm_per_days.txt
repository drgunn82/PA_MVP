INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Ustekinumab Subcutaneous
Drug Quantity Management Policy – Per Days
Ustekinumab subcutaneous (SC), an interleukin-12/23 blocker, is indicated for the
following uses:1-8
• Crohn’s disease, in patients ≥ 18 years of age with moderate to severe
active disease.
• Plaque psoriasis, in patients ≥ 6 years of age with moderate to severe
disease who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.
• Psoriatic arthritis, in patients ≥ 6 years of age with active disease.
• Ulcerative colitis, in patients ≥ 18 years of age with moderate to severe
active disease.
Dosing
Dosage recommendations for ustekinumab SC are:1-8
• Plaque psoriasis:
o Adults weighing ≤ 100 kg: 45 mg SC at Week 0, Week 4, and then once
every 12 weeks (Q12W) thereafter.
o Adults weighing > 100 kg: 90 mg SC at Week 0, Week 4, and then Q12W
thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age weighing < 60 kg: 0.75 mg/kg SC at
Week 0, Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age weighing 60 kg to 100 kg: 45 mg SC at
Week 0, Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age weighing < 60 kg: 90 mg SC at Week 0,
Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
• Psoriatic arthritis:
o Adults weighing > 100 kg with co-existent moderate to severe plaque
psoriasis: 90 mg SC at Week 0, Week 4, and then every Q12W thereafter.
o All other adults: 45 mg SC at Week 0, Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age weighing < 60 kg: 0.75 mg/kg at Week
0, Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age weighing ≥ 60 kg: 45 mg at Week 0,
Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age weighing > 100 kg with co-existent
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: 90 mg at Week 0, Week 4, and then
Q12W thereafter.
• Crohn’s disease: Starting 8 weeks after an initial intravenous (IV) dose, the
maintenance dose is 90 mg SC injection once every 8 weeks (Q8W).
• Ulcerative colitis: Starting 8 weeks after an initial IV dose, the maintenance
dose is 90 mg SC Q8W.
Dose Escalation in Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis
There are data to support dose escalation of ustekinumab SC from Q8W to Q4W or
Q6W in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who do not achieve remission
with the Q8W dosing.9-13 In STARDUST (n = 440), a phase 3b, multicenter,
randomized study, patients with moderate to severe, active Crohn’s disease initially
received ustekinumab 90 mg SC Q8W or Q12W.9 At Week 20 or 24, if the patient
had not achieved clinical, biochemical, or endoscopic remission, the dose could be
increased to Q8W (if previously receiving Q12W) or Q4W (if previously receiving
Q8W). Similar efficacy was demonstrated in the treat to target (dose escalation)

group vs. the standard of care group, but some patients benefited from Q4W
dosing. Additional systematic literature reviews, meta-analyses, and retrospective
cohort studies have also reported that dose intensification may benefit some
patients.10-13

POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to promote the safe,
effective, and economic use of ustekinumab SC, and to manage potential
premature dose escalation. If the Drug Quantity Management rule is not met at the
point of service, coverage will be determined by the Criteria below. All approvals
are provided for 1 year in duration, unless otherwise noted below. Of note, all
ustekinumab SC products of the same strength (i.e., vials, prefilled syringes)
accumulate toward the total quantity limit.
