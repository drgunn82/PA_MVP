INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Flucytosine, an antifungal, is indicated for the treatment of serious infections caused
by susceptible strains of Candida and/or Cryptococcus:1
• Candida infections: Septicemia, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, and urinary
system infections have been effectively treated with flucytosine. Limited trials
in pulmonary infections justify the use of flucytosine.
Note: Flucytosine does not have activity against C. krusei and should not be
used for infections caused by this Candida species.2
• Cryptococcus infections: Meningitis and pulmonary infections have been
treated effectively. Studies in septicemias and urinary tract infections are
limited, but good responses have been reported.1
Flucytosine should be used in combination with amphotericin B for the treatment of
systemic candidiasis and cryptococcosis due to emergence of resistance to
flucytosine; monotherapy for serious infections may also cause higher rates of
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Antifungals – Flucytosine Prior Authorization Policy
relapse and mortality.2 Flucytosine monotherapy can be used in candiduria without
systemic infection.
Treatment duration is varied; patients are treated until infection has cleared.2-4
There have been reports of flucytosine capsules being compounded for use as foot
baths. There are no data to support the use of flucytosine capsules in this manner
and coverage of flucytosine capsules for this use is not recommended.
Guidelines/Recommendations
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for treatment of Candida
infections (2016) note that flucytosine can be used as monotherapy or in combination
with other antifungals for these infections.2 The European Confederation of Medical
Mycology, the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology, and the
American Society of Microbiology developed global guidelines for the diagnosis and
management of Cryptococcosis (2024) and note that flucytosine should be used in
combination with other antifungals for these infections.
Flucytosine capsules may be extemporaneously compounded for vaginal use for
patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis.2,4 IDSA guidelines for the management of
candidiasis note 17% flucytosine cream to be an option, as monotherapy or in
combination with 3% amphotericin B cream, for the treatment of C. glabrata
vulvovaginitis unresponsive to oral azole antifungals (weak recommendation; low
quality evidence); duration of treatment is 14 days.
