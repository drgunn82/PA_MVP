INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Bimzelx, an interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F blocker, is indicated for the following
uses:1
• Ankylosing spondylitis, in adults with active disease.
• Hidradentitis suppurativa, in adults with moderate to severe disease.
• Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, in adults with active disease and
objective signs of inflammation.
• Psoriatic arthritis, in adults with active disease.
• Plaque psoriasis, in adults with moderate to severe disease who are
candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
In the pivotal trial for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, patients were required
to have objective signs of inflammation, indicated by elevated C-reactive protein
and/or sacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging.
Page 1 of 11 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Bimzelx Prior
Authorization Policy
Guidelines
Bimzelx is not addressed in available guidelines.
• Spondyloarthritis: Guidelines for ankylosing spondylitis and non-
radiographic axial spondylitis are published by the American College of
Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis
Research and Treatment Network (2019).2 Following primary non-response to
a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), either Cosentyx® (secukinumab
subcutaneous injection) or Taltz® (ixekizumab subcutaneous injection) is
recommended; however, if the patient is a secondary non-responder, a second
TNFi is recommended over changing classes. In patients with a
contraindication to a TNFi, use of an IL blocker is recommended over traditional
oral agents such as methotrexate or sulfasalazine.
• Hidradenitis Suppurativa: North American based hidradenitis suppurativa
guidelines have not been updated to address Bimzlex.3 Clinical management
guidelines from the US and Canadian Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundations
(2019) note that for acute lesions of all stages, antiseptic washes, short-term
oral steroids, and intralesional steroids are among the recommendations.
Systemic antibiotics have been a mainstay of treatment. Adalimumab (level
A strength of recommendation, level 1 evidence) is recommended to improve
disease severity and quality of life in moderate to severe disease. German
guidelines for hidradenitis suppurativa (2024) include recommendations for
use of adalimumab and Cosentyx (both “shall be recommended”) and Bimzelx
(“should be recommended”).4 Off-label use of other biologics are also listed,
but these generally have a lower level of recommendation (“may be
considered”).
• Psoriatic Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other
biologics for use in treatment-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis and in
those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.5
• Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines for the treatment of psoriasis with biologics
from the American Academy of Dermatologists and National Psoriasis
Foundation (2019) list the approved biologics that may be used as
monotherapy for adults with moderate to severe disease.6
Safety
There is a Warning/Precaution that Bimzelx may increase the risk of suicidal ideation
and behavior (SIB).1 Prescribers should weigh the potential risks and benefits before
using Bimzelx in patients with a history of severe depression or SIB. Prescribers
should also re-evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with Bimzelx
if such events occur. In the pivotal trials, patients with moderately severe to severe
depression, or a history of suicide attempt within the past 5 years were excluded.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Bimzelx. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Bimzelx as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Bimzelx Prior Authorization
Policy
requires Bimzelx to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Bimzelx® (bimekizumab-bkzx subcutaneous injection – UCB)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Bimzelx Prior Authorization
Policy
1. Concurrent Use with other Biologics or with Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drugs. The requested medication should not be administered in
combination with a biologic used for an inflammatory condition or with a targeted
synthetic oral small molecule drug (see Appendix for examples). Combination
therapy is generally not recommended due to a potential for a higher rate of
adverse effects with combinations and lack of controlled clinical trial data
supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine) in
combination with Bimzelx.
2. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (i.e., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis).
Exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, in some cases serious, occurred in
clinical trials involving patients treated with Bimzelx.1

Psoriatic Arthritis: Initial approval and for a patient currently
receiving Bimzelx, the requirement that the prescriber attests the
patient has been assessed and evaluated for risks of suicidal ideation
or behavior versus benefits of therapy was modified to “According to
the prescriber, the patient has been evaluated for risks of suicidal
ideation or behavior versus benefits of therapy”. Initial approval and
for a patient currently receiving Bimzelx, “According to the
prescriber” was added to the requirement that the patient does not
