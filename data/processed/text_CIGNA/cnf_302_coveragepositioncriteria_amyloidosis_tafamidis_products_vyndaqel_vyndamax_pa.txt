INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE

CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Vyndaqel and Vyndamax are selective stabilizers of transthyretin (TTR) indicated for
the treatment of the cardiomyopathy of wild-type or hereditary TTR-mediated
amyloidosis (ATTR-CM) to reduce cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular-
related hospitalization in adults.1 Studies excluded patients with New York Heart
Association class IV disease.2
Disease Overview
In ATTR-CM, there is misfolding of the TTR protein resulting in accumulation of
amyloid in the heart causing thickening of both ventricles.2-8 ATTR-CM may be
suspected following cardiac imaging (e.g., echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic
imaging). Subsequent testing (e.g., scintigraphy or biopsy) confirms the diagnosis of
ATTR-CM. Endomyocardial biopsy confirms the diagnosis of ATTR-CM.8 Biopsy can
confirm if ATTR-CM is due to a hereditary mutant variant of TTR vs. an acquired wild-
type variant. In patients with confirmed cardiac amyloidosis, TTR gene sequencing
aids in treatment decisions and is necessary for genetic counseling in relatives of
patients with a TTR variant.7 Although many mutations have been identified,
mutation of V122I is the most common in the US.2-6 This mutation is present in 3%
to 4% of African Americans and is associated with amyloid cardiomyopathy. Vyndaqel

and Vyndamax bind to TTR at the thyroxine binding sites and stabilize the tetramer.
This slows dissociation into monomers, which is the rate-limiting step in the
amyloidogenic process.1
Guidelines
The American Heart Association (AHA) scientific statement for the evolving diagnosis
and management of cardiac amyloidosis (2020) recognizes tafamidis as a treatment
for ATTR-CM.7 They note that the benefit of tafamidis has not been observed in
patients with NYHA class IV symptoms. Additionally, although combination use of
tafamidis with Onpattro® (patisiran lipid complex intravenous infusion) or Tegsedi®
(inotersen subcutaneous injection) is appealing to target both TTR silencing and
stabilization for the remaining synthesized protein, this approach lacks data and may
be cost-prohibitive. Tafamidis should generally be considered the agent of choice in
ATTR-CM in patients with reasonable expected survival according to a position
statement of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) working group on myocardial
and pericardial disease (2021).8 The working group notes that tafamidis is the only
drug that has shown efficacy in a randomized trial in patients with ATTR-CM and
should be considered in patients with reasonable expected survival. The American
College of Cardiology (ACC) expert consensus decision pathway on comprehensive
multidisciplinary care for patients with cardiac amyloidosis (2023) make similar
comments and recommendations to the AHA and ESC regarding tafamidis.10
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of tafamidis
products (Vyndaqel and Vyndamax). All approvals are provided for the duration noted
below. Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of
patients treated with tafamidis products (Vyndaqel and Vyndamax) as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires the agent to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine capsules – Pfizer)
• Vyndamax (tafamidis capsules – Pfizer)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Cardiomyopathy of Wild-Type or Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated
Amyloidosis (ATTR-CM). Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of the
following (A, B, C, D, and E):
Note: Variant Transthyretin Amyloidosis is also known as Hereditary
Transthyretin Amyloidosis.
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Amyloidosis – Tafamidis Products Prior Authorization
Policy
B) The diagnosis was confirmed by ONE of the following (i, ii, or iii):
i. A technetium pyrophosphate scan (i.e., nuclear scintigraphy); OR
ii. A tissue biopsy with confirmatory transthyretin (TTR) amyloid typing by
mass spectrometry, immunoelectron microscopy or
immunohistochemistry; OR
iii. Patient had genetic testing which, according to the prescriber, identified a
transthyretin (TTR) pathogenic variant; AND
Note: Examples of TTR variants include Val122Ile variant and Thr60Ala
variant. If the patient has wild-type amyloidosis, this is not a TTR
pathogenic variant.
C) Diagnostic cardiac imaging has demonstrated cardiac involvement; AND
Note: Examples of cardiac imaging include echocardiogram and cardiac
magnetic imaging. Examples of cardiac involvement on imaging include
increased thickness of the ventricular wall or interventricular septum.
D) Patient has heart failure, but does not have New York Heart Association class
IV disease; AND
E) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a cardiologist or a
physician who specializes in the treatment of amyloidosis.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Vyndaqel (tafamidis meglumine capsules – Pfizer)
• Vyndamax (tafamidis capsules – Pfizer)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concurrent use with other medications indicated for the treatment of
polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis or
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis-cardiomyopathy (e.g., Amvuttra
[vutrisiran subcutaneous injection], Attruby [acoramidis tablets],
Onpattro [patisiran lipid complex intravenous infusion], Tegsedi
[inotersen subcutaneous injection], or Wainua [eplontersen
subcutaneous injection]).
The requested medication should not be administered in combination with other
medications indicated for polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated
amyloidosis or transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis-cardiomyopathy. Combination
therapy is generally not recommended due to a lack of controlled clinical trial data
supporting additive efficacy.
2. Concurrent Use of Vyndaqel and Vyndamax. There are no data available to
support concomitant use.1
3. Polyneuropathy of Hereditary Transthyretin–Mediated Amyloidosis
(hATTR). Neither Vyndaqel nor Vyndamax are indicated for treatment of
symptoms of polyneuropathy associated with hATTR.1

Note: For patients with hATTR and cardiomyopathy or mixed phenotype
(concurrent cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy), refer to FDA-Approved
Indication, above.
