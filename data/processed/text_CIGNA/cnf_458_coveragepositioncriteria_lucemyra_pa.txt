INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Lofexidine, a central alpha-2 adrenergic agonist, is indicated for mitigation of
opioid withdrawal symptoms to facilitate abrupt opioid discontinuation in
adults.1
Lofexidine is typically dosed four times daily during the period of peak withdrawal
symptoms (generally the first 5 to 7 days following last use of opioid) with dosing
guided by symptoms and adverse events.1 Lofexidine treatment may continue for
up to 14 days with dosing guided by symptoms. Discontinue lofexidine with a
gradual dose reduction over a 2- to 4-day period to mitigate lofexidine withdrawal
symptoms.
Disease Overview
Page 1 of 3 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Lofexidine Prior Authorization Policy
Opioid use disorder is a primary, chronic and relapsing central nervous system
(CNS) disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry
characterized by an individual pathologically pursuing reward and/or relief by
substance use and other behaviors.2 Symptoms of opioid withdrawal usually begin
two to three half-lives after the last opioid dose (6 to 12 hours for short half-life
opioids such as heroin and morphine and 36 to 48 hours for long half-life opioids
such as methadone).3 Following cessation of a short half-life opioid, symptoms
reach peak intensity within 2 to 4 days, with most of the physical withdrawal signs
no longer apparent after 7 to 14 days. The duration of withdrawal also varies with
the half-life of the opioid used and the duration of use. While opioid withdrawal is
rarely life-threatening, the combination of uncomfortable symptoms and intense
craving makes completion of withdrawal difficult for most people.
Guidelines
The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) practice guideline for the
treatment of opioid use disorder (2020) discusses two primary strategies for the
management of opioid withdrawal.4 In one strategy, alpha-2 adrenergic agonists
(i.e., clonidine, lofexidine) are used along with other non-narcotic medications to
reduce withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, and
sweating. The use of non-opioid medications may be the only option available in
some healthcare settings and may also assist the transition of patients to opioid
antagonist medications (i.e., naltrexone) helping to prevent subsequent relapse.
Comparative data are limited but lofexidine and clonidine appear to be similarly
effective in the treatment of opioid withdrawal with hypotension occurring less
frequently with lofexidine. While clonidine is not FDA-approved for the treatment of
opioid withdrawal, it has been extensively used off-label for this purpose. Clonidine
can be combined with other non-narcotic medications targeting specific opioid
withdrawal symptoms. ASAM states that alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are safe and
effective for management of opioid withdrawal. However, the guideline notes that
methadone and buprenorphine are more effective in reducing the symptoms of
opioid withdrawal, in retaining patients in withdrawal management, and in
supporting the completion of withdrawal management.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of lofexidine.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
• Lucemyra® (lofexidine tablets – US WorldMeds, generic)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication

meets BOTH of the following (A and B):
Page 2 of 3 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Lofexidine Prior Authorization Policy
A) Lofexidine is being used to facilitate abrupt opioid discontinuation; AND
B) Patient has a history of clonidine use (e.g., patches, tablets) and experienced
unacceptable toxicity and/or inadequate efficacy.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Lucemyra® (lofexidine tablets – US WorldMeds, generic)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Cannabis Use Disorder (Cannabis Dependence). One published study has
evaluated the safety and efficacy of dronabinol and lofexidine in treating
cannabis dependence (n = 156).5 In this 11-week, placebo-controlled study,
the combined intervention did not show efficacy as a treatment for cannabis use
disorder.
