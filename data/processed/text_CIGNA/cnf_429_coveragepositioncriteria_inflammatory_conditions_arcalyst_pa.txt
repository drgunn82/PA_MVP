INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT

COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Arcalyst, an interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), including familial cold
autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), for
treatment of patients ≥ 12 years of age.
• Deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), for maintenance
of remission in adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 10 kg.
• Pericarditis, for treatment of recurrent disease and reduction in risk of
recurrence in patients ≥ 12 years of age.
In the pivotal trial for CAPS, patients had significant improvement in symptom scores
with Arcalyst through Week 6 which were maintained through Week 15.1 The pivotal
trial for DIRA enrolled patients with a loss of function IL1RN mutation who previously
experienced a benefit with Kineret® (anakinra subcutaneous injection). All patients
(n = 6) were in remission at Month 6 and sustained remission for the remainder of
Page 1 of 7 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Arcalyst Prior Authorization
Policy
the 2-year study. In the pivotal trial for pericarditis, patients had a mean of 4.7 total
episodes of pericarditis (standard deviation, ± 1.7 episodes), including the current
episode.3 All patients who enrolled in the study were symptomatic despite treatment
with standard treatment (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs],
colchicine, and/or systemic corticosteroids). Patients who responded to Arcalyst
during the initial 12 weeks of treatment, defined as C-reactive protein ≤ 0.5 mg/dL
with minimal or no pain (daily rating pain score), were eligible for continuation in the
randomized withdrawal period.
Guidelines
Arcalyst is used for treatment of a variety of periodic fever syndromes and
inflammatory conditions.
CAPS and DIRA
The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and American
College of Rheumatology (ACR) [2021] provide treatment guidelines for IL-1
mediated autoinflammatory diseases: cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes,
tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome, mevalonate kinase
deficiency, and deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist.4 Guidelines indicate IL-
blocking therapy has become the preferred treatment and a therapeutic trial with IL-
1 blocking agents may be started when strong clinical suspicious of a diagnosis of
CAPS, TRAPS, MKD, or DIRA is suspected. The guidelines also provide additional
diagnosis-specific treatment recommendations:
• CAPS: CAPS encompasses three rare genetic syndromes (familial cold
autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome, and neonatal onset
multisystem inflammatory disease formerly known as chronic infantile
neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome) that are thought to be one
condition along a spectrum of disease severity. IL-1 blockers are
recommended as standard of care across the spectrum of disease for improved
symptom control and reduced systemic and tissue/organ inflammation. The
dose and/or frequency of administration should be adjusted to control disease
activity, normalize markers of systemic inflammation, and for appropriate
weight gain and development in the growing patient.
• DIRA: DIRA is caused by recessive loss-of-function pathogenic variants in the
IL1RN gene. Treatment with agents that block both IL-α and IL-β is
recommended and includes Arcalyst and Kineret.
Pericarditis
Guidelines for acute and chronic pericarditis are available from the American College
of Cardiology (2020).2 A symptom-free interval of 4 to 6 weeks and evidence of new
pericardial inflammation are needed for a diagnosis of recurrent disease. For
recurrent disease, controlled clinical trials support a remarkable reduction in
recurrences with colchicine, which should be continued for at least 6 months.
Additionally, low-dose corticosteroids are associated with a high treatment success
rate. NSAIDs (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, indomethacin) are also listed as alternatives
for recurrent disease. Immunosuppressive drugs, including azathioprine,
methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil, are effective, well tolerated, and used as
corticosteroid-sparing agents. There is also limited evidence suggesting efficacy of

Policy
intravenous immunoglobulins. Although Arcalyst was not yet approved for recurrent
pericarditis, the guidelines note that benefit was shown in a Phase II study,
demonstrated by a decrease in chest pain and C-reactive protein levels.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Arcalyst. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Arcalyst as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Arcalyst to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Arcalyst® (rilonacept subcutaneous injection - Regeneron)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Biologic Therapy. Arcalyst should not be administered in
combination with another biologic agent for an inflammatory condition (see
Appendix for examples).1 Arcalyst has not been used in combination with tumor
necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis). An increased incidence of serious infections has
been associated with another interleukin-1 blocker (Kineret® [anakinra
