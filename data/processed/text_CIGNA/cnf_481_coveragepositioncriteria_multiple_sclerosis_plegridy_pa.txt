INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Plegridy, an interferon beta product, is indicated for the treatment of relapsing
forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing
remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease in adults.1
Disease Overview
MS is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating, autoimmune disease of the central
nervous system that impacts almost 1,000,000 people in the US.2-4 The condition
is marked by inflammation and demyelination, as well as degenerative alterations.
Patients usually experience relapses and remissions in their neurological symptoms.
For most patients, the onset of MS symptoms occurs when patients are 20 to 40
years of age; however, children can get MS and new onset disease can occur in
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Multiple Sclerosis (Injectable – Beta Interferon) –
Plegridy Prior Authorization Policy
older adults. The MS disease course is heterogeneous but has some patterns.
Approximately 85% to 90% of patients have a relapsing pattern at onset. However,
this transitions over time in patients who are untreated to a worsening with very
few or no relapses or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity (secondary
progressive MS). Around 10% to 15% of patients have a steady progression of
symptoms over time (primary progressive MS), marked by some clinical
manifestations or by MRI activity. Primary progressive MS is generally diagnosed in
patients on the upper level of the typical age range (e.g., almost 40 years of age)
and the distribution is equivalent among the two genders. Advances in the
understanding of the MS disease process, as well as in MRI technology, spurned
updated disease course descriptions in 2013,5 as well as in 2017.6 The revised
disease courses are clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting MS, primary
progressive MS, and secondary progressive MS.2-6 Clinically isolated syndrome is
now more recognized among the course descriptions of MS. It is the first clinical
presentation of MS that displays characteristics of inflammatory demyelination that
may possibly be MS but has yet to fulfill diagnostic criteria. It is notable that the
other MS designations can be further characterized considering whether patients
have active disease (or not active), as well as if disease is worsening or stable.
Disability in MS is commonly graded on the deterioration of mobility per the
Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) an ordinal scale that ranges from 0 to 10,
with higher scores indicating greater disability.
Guidelines
In September 2019, a consensus paper was updated by the MS Coalition that
discusses the use of disease-modifying therapies in MS.2 Many options from
various disease classes, involving different mechanisms of action and modes of
administration, have shown benefits in patients with MS.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Plegridy. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Plegridy as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Plegridy to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Plegridy® (peginterferon beta-1a subcutaneous or intramuscular
injection - Biogen)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication

i. Patient has a relapsing form of multiple sclerosis; AND
Note: Examples of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis include clinically
isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting disease, and active secondary
progressive disease.
ii. Medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist or a
physician who specializes in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Plegridy for ≥ 1 Year. Approve for 1 year if the

isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting disease, and active secondary
progressive disease.
ii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):
a) Patient experienced a beneficial clinical response when assessed by at
least one objective measure; OR
Note: Examples include stabilization or reduced worsening in disease
activity as evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [absence
or a decrease in gadolinium enhancing lesions, decrease in the number
of new or enlarging T2 lesions]; stabilization or reduced worsening on
the Expanded Disability State Scale (EDSS) score; achievement in
criteria for No Evidence of Disease Activity-3 (NEDA-3) or NEDA-4;
improvement on the fatigue symptom and impact questionnaire-
relapsing multiple sclerosis (FSIQ-RMS) scale; reduction or absence of
relapses; improvement or maintenance on the six-minute walk test or
12-Item MS Walking Scale; improvement on the Multiple Sclerosis
Functional Composite (MSFC) score; and/or attenuation of brain
volume loss.
b) Patient experienced stabilization, slowed progression, or improvement
in at least one symptom such as motor function, fatigue, vision,
bowel/bladder function, spasticity, walking/gait, or
pain/numbness/tingling sensation; AND
iii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a neurologist or a
physician who specializes in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Plegridy® (peginterferon beta-1a subcutaneous or intramuscular

Plegridy Prior Authorization Policy
1. Concurrent Use with Other Disease-Modifying Agents Used for Multiple
Sclerosis. These agents are not indicated for use in combination (See Appendix
for examples). Additional data are required to determine if use of disease-
modifying multiple sclerosis agents in combination is safe and provides added
efficacy.
2. Non-Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis. The efficacy of Plegridy has not
been established in patients with multiple sclerosis with non-relapsing forms of
multiple sclerosis.1
Note: An example of a non-relapsing form of multiple sclerosis is primary
progressive multiple sclerosis.
