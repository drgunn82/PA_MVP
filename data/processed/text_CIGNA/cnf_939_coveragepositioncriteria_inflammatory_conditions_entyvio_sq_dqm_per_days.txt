INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Entyvio subcutaneous (SC), an integrin receptor antagonist, is indicated for
treatment of the following uses:1
• Crohn’s disease, in adults with moderately to severely active disease.
• Ulcerative colitis, in adults with moderately to severely active disease.
Dosing
Therapy begins with Entyvio 300 mg IV at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by every 8
weeks thereafter.1 Alternatively, at Week 6, or at any scheduled Entyvio IV
infusion in patients with a clinical response or remission, therapy can be switched to
Entyvio SC. The recommended maintenance dose of Entyvio SC is 108 mg SC once
every 2 weeks (Q2W).

Dose Escalation in Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis
There are data to support dose escalation of Entyvio SC from Q2W to once weekly
(QW) in patients with inflammatory bowel disease who do not achieve remission
with the Q2W dosing.2 In VISIBLE OLE, an open-label extension study that enrolled
patients from the pivotal studies of Entyvio, VISIBLE-1 (ulcerative colitis study) and
VISIBLE-2 (Crohn’s disease study), patients experiencing treatment failure with
Entyvio SC Q2W could escalate to QW dosing. Treatment failure was defined as
disease worsening, need for rescue medications, or need for surgical intervention.
The VISIBLE OLE analysis included patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 231) or
Crohn’s disease (n = 344) who completed 52 weeks of treatment with Entyvio SC
Q2W or placebo in VISIBLE-1 or 2 and patients without a clinical response at Week
6 in VISIBLE-1 or 2 but who responded at Week 14 to Entyvio IV. Analysis did not
include patients that stopped VISIBLE-1 or 2 early due to treatment failure and
subsequently enrolled in the OLE with QW dosing.
• Among patients with ulcerative colitis who escalated to QW dosing during the
OLE (n = 63), 22.2% and 38.1% achieved clinical remission and response,
respectively, by Week 8 after transitioning to QW dosing. This was fairly
consistent through Week 48, and then steadily decreased through Week 168.
• Among patients with Crohn’s disease who escalated to QW dosing during the
OLE (n = 101), 38.6% and 53.5% achieved clinical remission and response,
respectively, by Week 8 after transitioning to QW. This steadily decreased
through Week 168.
Availability
Entyvio is available as a 108 mg/0.68 mL prefilled pens.1 Entyvio is also available
as a 300 mg vial for intravenous (IV). The IV product is not targeted in this policy.
POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to promote the safe,
effective, and economic use of Entyvio SC, and to manage potential premature dose
escalation. If the Drug Quantity Management rule is not met at the point of service,
coverage will be determined by the Criteria below. All approvals are provided for 1
year in duration, unless otherwise noted below.
