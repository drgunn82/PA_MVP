CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Opzelura, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Atopic dermatitis, for the topical short-term and non-continuous treatment of mild
to moderate disease in patients ≥ 12 years of age whose disease is not adequately
controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not
advisable.
• Nonsegmental vitiligo, for the topical treatment of patients ≥ 12 years of age.
Limitation of Use: Use of Opzelura in combination with therapeutic biologics, other JAK
inhibitors, or potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or cyclosporine is not
recommended.
For atopic dermatitis, Opzelura is applied twice daily to affected areas of up to 20% body
surface area (BSA). Patients should stop using Opzelura when signs and symptoms of
atopic dermatitis (e.g., itch, rash, and redness) resolve. If signs and symptoms do not
improve within 8 weeks, patients should be re-evaluated by their healthcare provider.
Page 1 of 9 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Dermatology – Opzelura Prior Authorization Policy
For vitiligo, Opzelura is applied twice daily to affected areas of up to 10% BSA.1 Patients
may require more than 24 weeks of treatment to achieve a satisfactory response. If the
patient does not find the repigmentation meaningful after 24 weeks of therapy, the patient
should be re-evaluated by their healthcare provider.
Clinical Efficacy
Atopic Dermatitis
Two pivotal Opzelura studies enrolled patients ≥ 12 years of age with a diagnosis of atopic
dermatitis present for ≥ 2 years, affecting 3% to 20% of their BSA.1,2 Patients were also
required to have an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 2 or 3. While prior
treatment was not a requirement for study enrollment, 90% of patients had received prior
therapies for atopic dermatitis, including low-, medium-, and high-potency topical
corticosteroids (49.6%, 42.4%, and 32.7% of patients, respectively), as well as topical
calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus 0.03% and 0.1% ointment and pimecrolimus 1%
cream [Elidel®, generic]) [21.5% of patients]. At Week 8, Opzelura cream was found to be
more effective in achieving IGA treatment success, defined as an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1
(almost clear) with a ≥ 2-grade improvement from baseline. A third, non-pivotal, Phase II
trial of Opzelura cream in a similar patient population included a triamcinolone acetonide
0.1% cream comparator arm.3 At Week 4, Opzelura 1.5% cream produced greater
improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index score from baseline; however, the
treatment difference vs. triamcinolone was not statistically significant.
Vitiligo
One Phase III Opzelura study enrolled patients ≥ 12 years of age with a diagnosis of non-
segmental vitiligo and depigmented areas covering ≤ 10% of their BSA.4 While prior
treatment was not a requirement for study enrollment, 61% of patients had received prior
topical therapies for vitiligo, including topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin
inhibitors. Efficacy was evaluated at Week 24.
Guidelines
Atopic Dermatitis Guidelines
In general, the American Academy of Dermatology Guidelines of Care for the Management
of Atopic Dermatitis (2023) recommends moisturizers/emollients as first-line therapy,
followed by topical corticosteroids, when appropriate.5 Topical calcineurin inhibitors are
recommended for the treatment of atopic dermatitis, particularly when use of topical
corticosteroids is not appropriate due to safety concerns (e.g., young infants, treatment of
sensitive areas such as the face, eyelids, or genitalia). Opzelura is recommended for the
treatment of patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. However, Opzelura should
not be used on more than 20% of the patient’s BSA to avoid potential adverse events.
Vitiligo Guidelines
Guidelines from the International Vitiligo Task Force (2023) recommend topical
corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and Opzelura as treatment options in patients
with vitiligo.6 Most of the studies to support the use of topical corticosteroids used potent to
very potent corticosteroids applied topically daily for 3 to 6 months.
Intermittent/alternating treatment schemes have been found to reduce adverse effects from
topical corticosteroids and may enable longer treatment periods. Topical corticosteroids
should be used with caution on the eyelids, axilla, and inguinal regions. Topical calcineurin
inhibitors are often prescribed initially for up to 6 months. The guidelines note that topical
corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors have not been found to be different in terms
of efficacy; however, there are safety differences. These therapies may be used in
combination. The guidelines do not compare the efficacy of Opzelura with that of the other
topical therapies.

Safety
Opzelura carries a Boxed Warning regarding the risk of serious infections, mortality,
malignancy and lymphoproliferative disorders, major adverse cardiac events, and
thrombosis.1 Other Warnings and Precautions include thrombocytopenia, anemia,
neutropenia, and lipid elevations. Based on these risks, critical evaluation and monitoring of
certain patients are recommended in the Opzelura prescribing information.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Opzelura cream. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Opzelura cream as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires Opzelura
cream to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Opzelura® (ruxolitinib 1.5% cream – Incyte)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including the
following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as newly
published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with other JAK inhibitors. Use of Opzelura in
combination with therapeutic biologics or other JAK inhibitors is not recommended (see
Appendix for examples).1 Use of biologics or other JAK inhibitors was prohibited during
the Opzelura pivotal studies.2 There are no data evaluating combination use of Opzelura
with these therapies; therefore, safety and efficacy of these combinations are unknown.
2. Concurrent use with Other Potent Immunosuppressants (e.g., azathioprine,
cyclosporine). Use of Opzelura in combination with potent immunosuppressants is not
recommended.1 Use of systemic immunosuppressants was prohibited during the
Opzelura pivotal studies.2 There are no data evaluating combination of Opzelura with
these therapies; therefore, safety and efficacy of these combinations are unknown.
3. Alopecia. Opzelura is not indicated for the treatment of alopecia.1 A Phase II study
involving patients with alopecia areata did not find any significant improvement in hair
regrowth with Opzelura 1.5% cream compared with vehicle.7 Additional data are
needed to establish the efficacy and safety of Opzelura in patients with alopecia.
