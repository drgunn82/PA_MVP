INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Nemluvio, an interleukin (IL)-31 receptor antagonist, is indicated for the following
uses:1
• Atopic dermatitis, for the treatment of patients ≥ 12 of age with moderate-
to-severe disease in combination with topical corticosteroids and/or topical
calcineurin inhibitors when the disease is not adequately controlled with
topical prescription therapies.
• Prurigo nodularis in adults.
Clinical Efficacy
Atopic Dermatitis
Two pivotal studies, ARCADIA 1 and ARCADIA 2, evaluated Nemluvio’s efficacy in
the treatment of atopic dermatitis in patients ≥ 12 years of age.1,2 These studies
evaluated efficacy after 16 weeks of Nemluvio therapy. According to the
prescribing information, Nemluvio should be used with topical corticosteroids and/or
topical calcineurin inhibitors. However, when the disease has sufficiently improved,
the labeling states to discontinue the use of topical therapies. In the ARCADIA
studies, concomitant topical corticosteroids and/or a topical calcineurin inhibitor
were administered during the trial. However, based on disease activity, these
therapies could be tapered and/or discontinued at the investigator’s discretion.

Prurigo Nodularis
Two pivotal studies, OLYMPIA 1 and OLYMPIA 2, evaluated Nemluvio’s efficacy in
the treatment of prurigo nodularis in patients ≥ 18 years of age.1,3,4 To enroll,
patients were required to have ≥ 20 nodular lesions distributed bilaterally on the legs,
and/or both arms, and/or trunk. Across both studies, 78.5% of patients had tried
topical corticosteroid therapy. Patients with chronic pruritus caused by an active
condition other than prurigo nodularis were excluded, as were patients with
neurpathic and psychogenic pruritis. In OLYMPIA 1, patients received an initial 24
weeks of randomized therapy, while in OLYMPIA 2 patients received 16 weeks of
treatment. The primary endpoints in both studies were evaluated at 16 weeks (4
months).
Guidelines
Atopic Dermatitis
Current atopic dermatitis guidelines do not make recommendations regarding
Nemluvio. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Guidelines for the
Care and Management of Atopic Dermatitis in Adults (topical therapies update in
2022 and systemic agents update in 2023) and the American Academy of
Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI)/American College of Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters
Atopic Dermatitis Guidelines (2023) continue to affirm that despite the availability
of newer, systemic therapies, topical agents remain the mainstay of treatment due
to their proven track record and favorable safety profiles.5-7 Several topical agents
are recommended, with topical corticosteroids commonly used first-line for mild to
severe atopic dermatitis in all skin regions. If topical therapy and basic
management (e.g., moisturizers, bathing modifications) have been optimized and
the patient has not achieved adequate control, systemic therapy may be
considered.
Prurigo Nodularis
A United States Expert Panel Consensus provides a practical approach for the
diagnosis and management of prurigo nodularis (2021).8 The primary findings in
patients with prurigo nodularis are the presence of firm, nodular lesions; pruritus
lasting at least 6 weeks; and history or signs, or both, of repeated scratching,
picking, or rubbing. Goals of treatment are to reduce pruritus, interrupt the itch-
scratch cycle, and completely heal prurigo nodularis lesions. Topical corticosteroids
are recommended as one of the treatments to address the immunologic component
of prurigo nodularis.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Nemluvio.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the
approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Nemluvio as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
6 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Immunologicals – Nemluvio Prior Authorization Policy
efficacy, initial approval requires Nemluvio to be prescribed by or in consultation
with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
