INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Tryvio, an endothelin receptor antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of
hypertension in combination with other antihypertensive medications, to
lower blood pressure in adults who are not adequately controlled on other drugs.1
Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular
events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.
Guidelines
Guidelines have not addressed Tryvio. Guidelines are available for the management
of hypertension in adults. There are many medications available for the
management of hypertension.2 These include thiazide-like diuretics (e.g.,
chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide, metolazone), potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g.,
amiloride, triamterene), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (e.g.,
spironolactone, eplerenone), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g.,
enalapril, lisinopril, ramipril, trandolapril), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)

[e.g., candesartan, irbesartan, valsartan], a direct renin inhibitor (i.e., aliskiren),
dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) [e.g., felodipine, amlodipine],
non-dihydropyridine CCBs (e.g., diltiazem, verapamil), beta blockers (e.g., atenolol,
bisoprolol, metoprolol, acebutolol), alpha-adrenergic blockers (e.g., doxazosin,
prazosin, terazosin), central alpha-adrenergic agonists (e.g., clonidine, guanfacine,
methyldopa), and direct vasodilators (e.g., hydralazine, minoxidil).
• American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association
(AHA) Guidelines for High Blood Pressure: The ACC/AHA guideline for
the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood
pressure in adults (2017) cites normal blood pressure (systolic blood
pressure [SBP]/diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) as < 120/80 mmHg; a SBP of
120 to 129 mmHg and a DBP > 80 mmHg is considered elevated.3 Stage 1
hypertension is denoted at SBPs of 130 to 139 mmHg and DBPs as 80 to 89
mmHg; Stage 2 hypertension is defined as a SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mmHg.3
The guidelines are extensive. In general, for initiation of antihypertensive
drug therapy (SBP/DBP ≥ 130/80 mmHg), first-line medications are thiazide
diuretics, CCBs, and ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Beta blockers are also
recommended in certain clinical scenarios in patients with hypertension (e.g.,
patients with stable ischemic heart disease or heart failure). For resistant
hypertension, consider spironolactone, if appropriate. The addition of other
agents with different mechanisms of action may also be useful (e.g.,
hydralazine, minoxidil, doxazosin, clonidine).
• AHA Statement on Resistant Hypertension: In 2018, the AHA published
a Scientific Statement on resistant hypertension.4 Resistant hypertension is
defined as above goal elevated blood pressure in a patient despite the
concurrent use of three antihypertensive drug classes, commonly including a
long-acting CCB, a blocker of the renin-angiotensin system (ACE inhibitor or
an ARB), and a diuretic. The antihypertensive drugs should be given at
maximum or maximally tolerated daily doses. Resistant hypertension also
includes patients whose blood pressure achieves target values with use of
four or more antihypertensive medications. Management of resistant
hypertension includes use of long-acting thiazide-like diuretics
(chlorthalidone or indapamide), the addition of a mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone), and, if blood pressure remains
elevated, the addition in a stepwise manner of antihypertensive medications
with complementary mechanisms of action to lower blood pressure.
