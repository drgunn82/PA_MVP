INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED.
FOR EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A
COVERAGE POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN
THE COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE
APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION
OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS
TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND
OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Voriconazole, an azole antifungal, is indicated in patients ≥ 2 years of age for the
following uses:1
• Candidemia, in non-neutropenic patients and other deep tissue Candida
infections.
• Esophageal candidiasis.
• Invasive aspergillosis.
• Scedosporium apiospermum (asexual form of Pseudallescheria boydii) and
Fusarium spp. (including Fusarium solani), in patients intolerant of, or
refractory to, other therapy.
The duration of voriconazole therapy is varied.1 The median duration for invasive
aspergillosis is 76 days, but can range to up to 232 days.

Prior Authorization Policy
Guidelines
The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends voriconazole as a
treatment option for the treatment or prevention of invasive aspergillosis (2016)
and for candidemia and candidiasis.2,3 Use of voriconazole for treatment of
infections caused by Candida spp and Aspergillus spp are also noted in the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the prevention and
treatment of cancer-related infections (version 1.2025 – June 20,2025).4 The IDSA
guidelines for management of candidiasis note voriconazole has demonstrated
effectiveness for candidemia and candidiasis, including mucosal and invasive
candidiasis (e.g., Candida intravascular infections, including endocarditis and
infections of implantable cardiac devices; fluconazole-refractory oropharyngeal
candidiasis; Candida endophthalmitis).3 Voriconazole represents an option in the
first-line treatment of infections due to Scedosporium spp and Fusarium spp.5
NCCN guidelines also notes voriconazole as a treatment option for the prevention of
fungal infections in patients with significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
[especially grade 3/4] who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy; treatment
should continue until resolution of significant GVHD.4 Voriconazole is also a
treatment option for these groups of patients with neutropenia: patients with
myelodysplastic syndrome, patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and patients who
are allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients; treatment should continue
until resolution of neutropenia.
The IDSA guidelines for the management of blastomycosis (2008; archived) note
voriconazole as an option for the treatment of central nervous system
blastomycosis.6
The Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Opportunistic Infections in Adults
and Adolescents with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infections (last updated
April 2025) recommend voriconazole as a treatment option for the
prophylaxis/treatment of various fungal infections (e.g., candidiasis, histoplasmosis,
coccidioidomycosis, and talaromycosis) in patients with HIV.7
