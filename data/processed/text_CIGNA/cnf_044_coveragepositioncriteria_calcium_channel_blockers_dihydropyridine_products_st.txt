CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Calcium Channel Blockers – Dihydropyridine Products
Step Therapy Policy
All of the dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel blockers (CCBs), with the
exception of immediate-release (IR) nifedipine and nimodipine, are indicated for the
treatment of hypertension in adults.1-14,9 Some of the DHB CCBs have unique
indications:
• Agents that are indicated for the management of chronic stable angina
include amlodipine, nicardipine IR, nifedipine IR, and nifedipine extended-
release (ER) [Procardia XL formulation].
• Agents that are indicated for the treatment of vasospastic angina include
amlodipine, nifedipine IR, and nifedipine ER (Procardia XL formulation).
• Amlodipine possess a unique indication in patients with recently
documented coronary artery disease (CAD) by angiography and
without heart failure (HF) or an ejection fraction < 40% to reduce
the risk of hospitalization due to angina and to reduce the risk of a
coronary revascularization procedure. Amlodipine is indicated for use in
adults and pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age.
• Conjupri is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and
pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age to lower blood pressure.24 An authorized
generic is available.27
• Katerzia may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive or
antianginal medications for the treatment of hypertension in adults and
children ≥ 6 years of age and CAD (chronic stable angina, vasospastic
angina, and angiographically documented CAD in patients without heart
failure or an ejection fraction < 40%).25
• Norliqva may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive
or antianginal medications for the treatment of hypertension in adults and
children ≥ 6 years of age and CAD [chronic stable angina, vasospastic
angina, and angiographically documented CAD in patients without heart
failure or an ejection fraction < 40%].26
Prestalia contains amlodipine and perindopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitor.6
The DHP CCB nimodipine is not discussed in this document since it is only indicated
to improve neurological deficits associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage and is
given every 4 hours for a 21-day period.13,14
Many of the available DHP CCBs can be dosed once daily (QD), which may be
important in the treatment of hypertension to ensure adequate blood pressure
control over a 24-hour period and in the treatment of angina to avoid fluctuations in
blood pressure and heart rate. The only DHP CCBs that are not dosed QD are
isradipine IR, dosed twice daily (BID), and nicardipine IR and nifedipine IR, both of
which are dosed three to four times daily (TID to QID).
Hypertension
The DHP CCBs indicated in the treatment of hypertension have been found to be
effective. These agents are useful for many reasons, such that the blood pressure
response is less contingent on patient factors such as race and age, the agents are
metabolically neutral and do not disturb glucose homeostasis, and some agents
6 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Calcium Channel Blockers – Dihydropyridine Products Step
Therapy Policy
have conferred cardiovascular benefit.15 In 2017, the American College of
Cardiology , along with other nationally-recognized groups, published extensive
guidelines regarding the management of high blood pressure in adults. CCBs are
recommended among the choice of first-line agents as antihypertensive
medications. Refer to the full guidelines for additional details.23 The Eigth Report
of the Joint National Committee (JNC 8) 2014 evidence-based guideline for the
management of high blood pressure in adults recommends CCBs as one of the
initial choices of therapy in various scenarios.16 Currently, the only DHP CCB
indicated for the treatment of hypertension in children is amlodipine (patients aged
6 to 17 years).1 In 2017, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a
clinical practice guideline regarding the management of high blood pressure in
children and adolescents.17 Long-acting CCBs are among the first-line choices for
patients initiating antihypertensive therapy.
Angina
In 2023, the American Heart Association and the American College of
Cardiology, along with other national organizations, published guidelines regarding
the management of patients with chronic coronary disease.18 Either a calcium
channel blocker or beta blocker is recommended as first-line antianginal therapy.
In adults with chronic coronary disease and hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥
130 and/or diastolic blood pressure BP ≥ 80 mm Hg), in addition to
nonpharmacological strategies, guideline-directed medication therapy with
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARB), or beta blockers are recommended as first-line therapy for compelling
indications (e.g., recent MI or angina), with additional antihypertensive medications
(e.g., dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers [CCB], long-acting thiazide
diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists) added as needed to
optimize blood pressure control. In patients with chronic coronary disease and
angina, antianginal therapy with either a beta blocker, CCB, or long-acting nitrate is
recommended for relief of angina or equivalent symptoms. In such patients who
remain symptomatic after initial treatment, addition of a second antianginal agent
from a different therapeutic class (beta blockers, CCBs, long-acting nitrates) is
recommended for relief of angina or equivalent symptoms.
Heart Failure (HF)
Most of the clinical data available on the use of DHP CCBs in patients with HF are
with amlodipine, followed by felodipine, although neither product is indicated for
HF.19-21 The amlodipine prescribing information notes that amlodipine has been
compared with placebo in several studies of 8 to 12 weeks duration in patients with
New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II/III HF (n = 697) and no evidence of
worsening HF was noted.1 The Prospective Randomized Amlodipine Evaluation
(PRAISE) study (n = 1,153) is also detailed which involved use of amlodipine (5 to
10 mg) in patients with Class III/IV HF who were receiving other medications for HF
(diuretics, digoxin, ACE inhibitors).1,19 Amlodipine had no effect on the primary
endpoint, which was the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and cardiac
morbidity. The primary endpoint occurred in 42% of patients given placebo vs.
39% in the amlodipine group after a median follow-up of 13.8 months.1,19 The
PRAISE-2 trial is also mentioned in the amlodipine prescribing information which
6 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Calcium Channel Blockers – Dihydropyridine Products Step
Therapy Policy
randomized patients with NYHA Class III (80%) or IV (20%) HF who had no clinical
symptoms or objective evidence of underlying ischemic disease to receive placebo
or amlodipine, in addition to other HF therapies. After a mean follow-up of 33
months, there was no difference between amlodipine and placebo in the primary
endpoint of all-cause mortality.1 The 2022 American College of Cardiology
Foundation /American Heart Association /Heart Failure Society of America
guideline for the management of HF states that DHP CCBs are not recommended
for patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction; no distinct benefits
are noted.22 DHP CCBs may be used for the treatment of hypertension in patients
who have elevated blood pressure despite optimization of guideline-directed
medication therapy. Among the DHP CCBs, amlodipine and felodipine are thought
to have less myocardial depressant activity and may be more favorable agents.22
POLICY STATEMENT
This program has been developed to encourage the use of a Step 1 Product prior to
the use of a Step 2 Product, for all agents except Prestalia. For Prestalia, this
program requires the patient to try one Step 1 Product (a generic dihydropyridine-
calcium channel blocker [DHP CCB] or a generic DHP CCB-combination product)
and one angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. If the Step Therapy rule is
not met for a Step 2 Product at the point of service, coverage will be determined by
the Step Therapy criteria below. All approvals are provided for 1 year in duration.
Step 1: Afeditab CR, amlodipine, amlodipine/atorvastatin, amlodipine/benazepril,
felodipine ER, isradipine IR, nicardipine IR, nifedipine ER, nifedipine IR,
nifedipine XL, Nifediac CC, Nifedical XL, nisoldipine ER
Step 2: Conjupri, Katerzia, Levamlodipine (authorized generic), Norliqva, Norvasc,
Prestalia, Procardia, Procardia XL, Sular
