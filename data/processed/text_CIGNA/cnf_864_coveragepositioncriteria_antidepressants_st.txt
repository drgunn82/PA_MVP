INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
The following Coverage Policy applies to health benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Certain Cigna
Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make coverage
determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and coverage determinations do not apply to those
clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered
by Cigna Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service
Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan
document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based.
For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a
Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supersedes the information in
the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately
determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance
require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any
applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the
specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical
directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment where appropriate and have discretion in making individual
coverage determinations. Where coverage for care or services does not depend on specific circumstances,
reimbursement will only be provided if a requested service(s) is submitted in accordance with the relevant criteria
outlined in the applicable Coverage Policy, including covered diagnosis and/or procedure code(s). Reimbursement is
not allowed for services when billed for conditions or diagnoses that are not covered under this Coverage Policy (see
"Coding Information" below). When billing, providers must use the most appropriate codes as of the effective date
of the submission. Claims submitted for services that are not accompanied by covered code(s) under the applicable
Coverage Policy will be denied as not covered. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health
benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment
guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other
coverage determinations.
Cigna National Formulary Coverage:
OVERVIEW
Bupropion Products Aplenzin, Auvelity, Forfivo XL (authorized generics),
bupropion hydrochloride (HCl) sustained-release (SR) tablets, and bupropion HCl
extended-release (ER) tablets are indicated for the treatment of depression.1-5
Bupropion HCl ER tablets and Aplenzin are also indicated for the prevention of
seasonal major depressive episodes in patients with seasonal affective disorder.2,3
Table 1 lists the available bupropion-containing products.

HBr – Hydrobromide; HCl – Hydrochloride; ER – Extended-release; CYP – Cytochrome P450; SR –
Sustained-release.
Aplenzin contains bupropion hydrobromide (HBr). Of note, 174 mg/day of
bupropion HBr is equivalent to 150 mg/day of bupropion HCl.3 Therefore, when
switching patients from bupropion HCl SR or ER tablets to Aplenzin (or vice versa),
it is possible to give equivalent daily doses. Aplenzin is bioequivalent to bupropion
HCl ER tablets, which has been demonstrated to have similar bioavailability to both
the immediate-release and the SR formulations of bupropion. Forfivo XL
(authorized generics) is available as 450 mg ER tablets, while the other bupropion
HCl ER tablets are available as 150 mg or 300 mg.2,4
Auvelity contains a combination of dextromethorphan HBr, an uncompetitive N-
methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist and sigma-1 receptor agonist, and
bupropion HCl, an aminoketone and cytochrome P450 (CYP)2D6 inhibitor.5 Each
tablet contains 45 mg dextromethorphan HBr (equivalent to 32.98 mg
dextromethorphan base) in an immediate-release formulation and 105 mg
bupropion HCl (equivalent to 91.14 mg bupropion base) in an ER formulation.
Zyban (bupropion HCl SR, generic only) contains the same active ingredient as
bupropion HCl SR and ER tablets and Forfivo XL (authorized generics); however,
Zyban is indicated as an aid to smoking cessation treatment.6 Because of the
different indication for use, Zyban is not included in this policy.
Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) Products
The SSRIs comprise a pharmacologic class of agents with antidepressant action and
efficacy in the treatment of a wide range of mood and anxiety disorders (see Table

Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) Products
Desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, Fetzima, and venlafaxine are SNRIs indicated for the
treatment of depression.22-31 Additional indications vary by product. Table 3
provides the approved indications for the available SSRIs. While Savella is
approved outside the US for major depressive disorder (MDD), it is not in
development for this indication in the US.
A venlafaxine hydrochloride (HCl) extended-release tablet formulation and a
venlafaxine besylate extended-release tablet are also available.26,27 These
formulations do not carry the same indications as the capsule formulation (Effexor
XR, generic). Venlafaxine HCl extended-release tablets are indicated for MDD and
social anxiety disorder.26 Equal doses of venlafaxine HCl extended-release tablets
are bioequivalent to venlafaxine extended-release capsules (Effexor XR, generic)
when administered under fed conditions; however, these products are not AB-rated
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Antidepressants Step Therapy Policy
to each other. Venlafaxine besylate extended-release tablets are indicated for MDD
and GAD, and they are only available in a 112.5 mg strength.27 Venlafaxine
besylate extended-release tablets cannot be used to initiate venlafaxine treatment,
titrate by doses less than 112.5 mg, or taper treatment.
Similarly, in addition to desvenlafaxine succinate extended-release tablets (Pristiq,
generic), branded Desvenlafaxine is available.25,29 Desvenlafaxine and
desvenlafaxine succinate are available in the same strength extended-release
tablets, and share the same indication (treatment of MDD). Desvenlafaxine,
Desvenlafaxine fumarate (discontinued), and desvenlafaxine succinate are not AB-
rated to each other. However, efficacy studies conducted with desvenlafaxine
succinate are cited in the Desvenlafaxine product information. Drizalma Sprinkle
relied on clinical efficacy studies for Cymbalta for approval and has the same
indications as Cymbalta with the exception of a fibromyalgia indication.22,30
