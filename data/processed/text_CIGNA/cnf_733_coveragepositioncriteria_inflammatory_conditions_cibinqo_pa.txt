REVIEW DATE: 02/26/2025; selected revision 04/23/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Cibinqo, a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi), is indicated for treatment of refractory,
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in patients ≥ 12 years of age whose disease
is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products (including biologics)
or when those therapies are not advisable.1
Cibinqo is not recommended for use in combination with other JAKis, biologic
immunomodulators, or with other immunosuppressants.
Guidelines
Guidelines for the care and management of atopic dermatitis from the American
Academy of Dermatology (2023) and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and
Immunology (2023) have been updated to address Cibinqo.2,3 Systemic therapies
are recommended in patients with moderate to severe or widespread disease, in
Page 1 of 6: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions - Cibinqo Prior
Authorization Policy
those with impaired quality of life, and those whose atopic dermatitis is refractory to
topical therapies. Biologic agents, such as Dupixent® (dupilumab subcutaneous
injection) and Adbry® (tralokinumab-ldrm subcutaneous injection), are
recommended as initial systemic treatment due to their favorable efficacy and safety
profiles compared to traditional systemic therapies (e.g., azathioprine, cyclosporine,
methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil). Cibinqo may be considered in adults
refractory or intolerant to systemic therapy, including biologics.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Cibinqo. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Cibinqo as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Cibinqo to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes
in the condition being treated.
• Cibinqo® (abrocitinib tablets – Pfizer)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Atopic Dermatitis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of
the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 3 months if the patient meets ALL of the following
(i, ii, and iii):
i. Patient is ≥ 12 years of age; AND
ii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):
a) Patient has had a 4-month trial of at least ONE systemic therapy; OR
b) Patient has tried at least ONE systemic therapy but was unable to
tolerate a 4-month trial; AND
Note: Examples of systemic therapies include Dupixent (dupilumab
subcutaneous injection), Ebglyss (lebrikizumab-lbkz subcutaneous
injection), Nemluvio (nemolizumab-ilto subcutaneous injection), and
Adbry (tralokinumab-ldrm subcutaneous injection). Methotrexate,
azathioprine, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil also count
towards trial of a systemic therapy.
iii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an allergist,
immunologist, or dermatologist; OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Cibinqo. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
ALL of the following (i, ii, and iii):
i. Patient has already received at least 90 days of therapy with Cibinqo; AND
Note: A patient who has received < 90 days of therapy or who is restarting
therapy with Cibinqo should be considered under Initial Therapy.

Authorization Policy
ii. Patient experienced a beneficial clinical response, defined as improvement
from baseline (prior to initiating Cibinqo) in at least one of the following:
estimated body surface area affected, erythema,
induration/papulation/edema, excoriations, lichenification, and/or a
decreased requirement for other topical or systemic therapies for atopic
dermatitis; AND
iii. Compared with baseline (prior to receiving Cibinqo), patient experienced
an improvement in at least one symptom, such as decreased itching.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Cibinqo® (abrocitinib tablets – Pfizer)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drugs. The requested medication should not be administered in
combination with a biologic used for an inflammatory condition or with a targeted
synthetic oral small molecule drug (see Appendix for examples). Combination
therapy is generally not recommended due to a potential for a higher rate of
adverse effects with combinations and lack of controlled clinical trial data
supporting additive efficacy.
2. Concurrent Use with a Biologic Immunomodulator. Cibinqo is not
recommended in combination with biologic immunomodulators.1
Note: Examples include Adbry (tralokinumab-ldrm subcutaneous injection),
Cinqair (reslizumab intravenous), Dupixent (dupilumab subcutaneous injection),
Ebglyss (lebrikizumab-lbkz subcutaneous injection), Nemluvio (nemolizumab-ilto
subcutaneous injection), Fasenra (benralizumab subcutaneous injection), Nucala
(mepolizumab subcutaneous injection), Tezspire (tezepelumab-ekko
subcutaneous injection), and Xolair (omalizumab subcutaneous injection).
3. Concurrent Use with Other Janus Kinase Inhibitors (JAKis). Cibinqo is not
recommended in combination with other JAKis, such as Rinvoq (upadacitinib
tablets), Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR (tofacitinib tablets/ tofacitinib extended-release
tablets), Olumiant (baricitinib tablets).1
4. Concurrent Use with Other Potent Immunosuppressants (e.g.,
azathioprine, cyclosporine).1 Coadministration with other potent
immunosuppressive drugs has the risk of added immunosuppression and has not
been evaluated.
