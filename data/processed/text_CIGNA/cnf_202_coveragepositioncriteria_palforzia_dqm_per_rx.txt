ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN

ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Palforzia, an oral immunotherapy, is indicated for the mitigation of allergic
reactions, including anaphylaxis, that may occur with accidental exposure to
peanut.1 It is approved for use in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of peanut
allergy. Initial dose escalation may be administered to patients 1 through 17 years
of age; up-dosing and maintenance may be continued in patients ≥ 1 year of age.
Palforzia is labeled to be used in conjunction with a peanut-avoidant diet. It is not
indicated for the emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.
Prior to initiation, the prescriber should verify that the patient has injectable
epinephrine and has been instructed on its appropriate use.
Dosing
There are three sequential phases of Palforzia administration: Initial Dose
Escalation, Up-Dosing, and Maintenance.1
Initial Dose Escalation. The Initial Dose Escalation is administered on a single day
under the supervision of a healthcare professional in a healthcare setting with the

Management Policy – Per Rx
ability to manage possibly severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Doses
are administered in a sequential order based on age, as outlined in Table 1.
Patients 4 to 17 years of age progress through dose Levels A through E, while
patients 1 to 3 years of age progress through dose Levels A through D. Each dose
is given 20 to 30 minutes apart while the patient is observed. No dose level should
be omitted. After the last dose, patients should be monitored for 60 minutes.
Palforzia should be discontinued if the patient has symptoms requiring medical
intervention following any dose.
Table 1. Dosing Configuration for Palforzia Initial Dose Escalation.1*
Dose Level Total Dose Dose Configuration
A 0.5 mg One 0.5 mg capsule
B 1 mg One 1 mg capsule
C 1.5 mg One 0.5 mg capsule; one 1 mg capsule
D 3 mg Three 1 mg capsules
Eα 6 mg Six 1 mg capsules
* Each dose is administered 20 to 30 minutes apart while the patient is observed; α Patients 4 to 17
years of age only. Patients 1 to 3 years of age progress through levels A through D only.
Up-Dosing. Patients 1 to 3 years of age who tolerate all doses during the Initial
Dose Escalation and patients 4 to 17 years of age who tolerate at least the 3 mg
dose during the Initial Dose Escalation must return to the healthcare setting for
initiation of Up-Dosing.1 If possible, Up-Dosing should begin the day after Initial
Dose Escalation. If the patient is unable to begin Up-Dosing within 4 days, Initial
Dose Escalation in a healthcare setting must be repeated. Up-Dosing consists of 12
dosing levels starting at Level 0 (1 mg daily dose) for patients 1 to 3 years of age
and 11 dosing levels starting at Level 1 (3 mg daily dose) in patients 4 to 17 years
of age (Table 2). The first dose of each new level must be administered under the
supervision of a healthcare professional in a healthcare setting where the patient is
monitored for at least 60 minutes. If the new dose level is tolerated, the patient
may continue daily dosing at that dose level at home.

Management Policy – Per Rx
Maintenance. Following completion of all levels of Up-Dosing, the maintenance
dose of Palforzia is 300 mg once daily (QD) supplied in a sachet.1 Daily
maintenance dosing is required to maintain Palforzia’s effect. The patient should be
contacted at regular intervals during maintenance dosing to assess for adverse
reactions.
Dose Modification. The dose should not be modified during Initial Dose Escalation.1
In some situations, temporary dose modification may be appropriate during Up-
Dosing or Maintenance if a patient misses doses, or for practical reasons of patient
management. Allergic reactions (including gastrointestinal adverse events) that are
severe, recurrent, bothersome, or last longer than 90 minutes should be actively
managed with dose modifications. Clinical judgement should be used to determine
the best course of action, which can include maintaining the dose level for longer
than 2 weeks, reducing, withholding, or discontinuing Palforzia.
Missed Doses. If a patient misses 1 to 2 consecutive days of doses, Palforzia may
be resumed at the same dose level. However, data are insufficient to advise on
resuming Palforzia after 3 or more consecutive days of missed doses. If a patient
misses ≥ 3 consecutive days of Palforzia should consult their healthcare provider
and resume Palforzia under medical supervision.
Discontinuation. Palforzia should be discontinued in the following situations:
• Patients 1 to 3 years of age who are unable to tolerate any dose during the
Initial Dose Escalation.
• Patients 4 to 17 years of age who are unable to tolerate doses up to and
including the 3 mg dose during Initial Dose Escalation.
• Patients with suspected eosinophilic esophagitis.
• Patients unable to be compliant with daily dosing requirements.
• Patients who have recurrent asthma exacerbations or persistent loss of asthma
control.

Dose Escalation Kits, as well as kits to accommodate each level of Up-Dosing and
