CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Qulipta, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist, is indicated
for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.1
Disease Overview
Migraine is a common, ongoing condition marked by paroxysmal, unilateral attacks
of moderate to severe throbbing headache.2 Migraines are aggravated by routine
physical activity (e.g., walking or climbing stairs) and associated with nausea,
vomiting, and/or photophobia and phonophobia. Migraines have been defined as
chronic or episodic. Chronic migraine is described by the International Headache
Society as headache occurring on ≥ 15 days/month for more than 3 months, which
has the features of migraine headache on ≥ 8 days/month. Episodic migraine is
characterized by headaches that occur < 15 days/month.
Guidelines
An updated assessment of the preventive and acute treatment of migraine by
the American Headache Society (AHS) [2018; update 2021] reaffirms previous
migraine guidelines.3,4 Patients with migraine should be considered for preventive
treatment in the following situations: when attacks significantly interfere with
patients’ daily routines despite acute treatment; frequent attacks (≥ 4 monthly
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Migraine – Qulipta Prior Authorization Policy
headache days); at least moderate disability (Migraine Disability Assessment
[MIDAS] score ≥ 11 or six-item Headache Impact Test [HIT-6] score > 50);
contraindication to, failure, overuse, or adverse events with acute treatments; or
patient preference. Before developing a preventive treatment plan, the appropriate
use (e.g., drug type, route and timing of administration, frequency) of acute
treatments should be initiated and coupled with education and lifestyle modifications.
All patients with migraine should be offered a trial of acute treatment. Based on the
level of evidence for efficacy and the American Academy of Neurology scheme for
classification of evidence, the following oral treatments have established efficacy and
should be offered for migraine prevention: antiepileptic drugs (divalproex sodium,
valproate sodium, topiramate [not for females of childbearing potential without a
reliable method of birth control]); beta-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol,
timolol); and frovatriptan (for short-term preventive treatment of menstrual
migraine). The following treatments are probably effective and should be considered
for migraine prevention: antidepressants (amitriptyline, venlafaxine); beta-
blockers (atenolol, nadolol); and angiotensin receptor blockers (candesartan).
The AHS issued an update to their position statement (2024) specifically regarding
therapies targeting CGRP for the prevention of migraine.5 The evidence for the
efficacy, tolerability, and safety of CGRP-targeting migraine preventive therapies
(specifically, the monoclonal antibodies: Aimovig [erenumab-aooe subcutaneous
{SC} injection], Ajovy® [fremanezumab-vfrm SC injection], Emgality®
[galcanezumab-gnlm SC injection], and Vyepti® [eptinezumab-jjmr intravenous
infusion], and the gepants: Nurtec® ODT [rimegepant orally disintegrating tablets]
and Qulipta is substantial and consistent across different individual CGRP-targeting
treatments. Extensive “real-world” clinical experience corroborates clinical trials.
This data indicates that the efficacy and tolerability of CGRP-targeting therapies are
equal to or greater than those of previous first-line therapies. The CGRP-targeting
therapies should be considered as a first-line approach for migraine prevention along
with previous first-line treatments without a requirement for prior failure of other
classes of migraine preventive treatment. Additionally, Botox® (onabotulinumtoxinA
SC injection) is considered a first-line therapy for prevention of chronic migraine.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Qulipta. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
• Qulipta® (atogepant tablets – AbbVie)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Migraine – Qulipta Prior Authorization Policy
1. Migraine Headache Prevention. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of
the following (A, B, and C):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) Patient has ≥ 4 migraine headache days per month (prior to initiating a
migraine-preventive medication); AND
C) If the patient is currently taking Qulipta, patient has had a significant clinical
benefit from the medication as determined by the prescriber.
Note: Examples of significant clinical benefit include a reduction in the overall
number of migraine days per month or a reduction in number of severe
migraine days per month from the time that Qulipta was initiated.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Qulipta® (atogepant tablets – AbbVie)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with Another Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP)
Inhibitor Being Prescribed for Migraine Headache Prevention.
Note: CGRP inhibitors that are indicated for migraine headache prevention include
Aimovig (erenumab-aooe subcutaneous injection), Ajovy (fremanezumab-vfrm
subcutaneous injection), Emgality (galcanezumab-gnlm subcutaneous injection),
Vyepti (eptinezumab-jjmr intravenous infusion), Nurtec ODT (rimegepant sulfate
orally disintegrating tablets), and Qulipta (atogepant tablets). Aimovig, Ajovy,
Emgality, and Vyepti are injectable CGRP inhibitors for migraine prevention and
have not been studied for use in combination with another agent in the same
class.6-9 Nurtec ODT is an oral CGRP inhibitor indicated for the acute treatment
of migraine and for preventive treatment of episodic migraine.10 Clinical trials of
Nurtec ODT for the prevention of episodic migraine did not permit the use of a
concomitant medication that acts on the CGRP pathway.

Revision from Preventive Treatment of Migraine to Migraine Headache
Prevention. The note with standard prophylactic (preventive)
pharmacologic therapies was changed to remove “Examples of” and
