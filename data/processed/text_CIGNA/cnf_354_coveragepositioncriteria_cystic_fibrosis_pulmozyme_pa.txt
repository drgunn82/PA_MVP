INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Pulmozyme, a recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I, is indicated in conjunction
with standard therapies for the management of patients with cystic fibrosis to
improve pulmonary function.1
Guidelines
According to Patient Registry data compiled by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (2023),
Pulmozyme is used by the vast majority of patients with cystic fibrosis.2 Guidelines
from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (2007, updated in 2013) address the chronic use
of medications for management of lung health in cystic fibrosis patients ≥ 6 years of
age.3,4 These guidelines recommend Pulmozyme use for patients with cystic fibrosis
regardless of disease severity to improve lung function and reduce exacerbations.
Separate guidelines have addressed Pulmozyme use in younger patients.5,6 Although
efficacy data are lacking in patients < 5 years of age, safety and tolerability have
been established in patients as young as 3 months.1,6 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation

Authorization Policy
guidelines for infants < 2 years of age (2009) and children between 2 and 5 years of
age (2016) support Pulmozyme use in these populations based on individual
circumstances.5,6
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Pulmozyme.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Pulmozyme as
well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Pulmozyme to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Pulmozyme® (dornase alfa inhalation solution – Genentech/Roche)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Cystic Fibrosis. Approve for 1 year if the medication is prescribed by or in
consultation with a pulmonologist or a physician who specializes in the treatment
of cystic fibrosis.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Pulmozyme® (dornase alfa inhalation solution – Genentech/Roche)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Asthma. Mucus hypersecretion may be mediated by a variety of causes, including
inflammation, irritation, stimulation, or mucus-producing tumors.7 However,
efficacy of Pulmozyme is not established for conditions other than cystic fibrosis.10
In a pilot study of patients with severe acute asthma (n = 50), there was no
significant difference in forced expiratory volume in 1 second with Pulmozyme use
vs. placebo.8,10
3. Bronchiectasis, Idiopathic. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled 24-week trial (n = 349) examined the effect of Pulmozyme vs. placebo
in patients with idiopathic bronchiectasis (i.e., bronchiectasis not related to cystic
fibrosis).9 Patients in the Pulmozyme arm experienced worsened lung function
and more frequent pulmonary exacerbations vs. placebo. The authors concluded
that Pulmozyme should not be used in this population. Another small double-blind,
placebo-controlled, Phase II trial (n = 14) examined Pulmozyme in adults with
non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Pulmozyme failed to show any significant
change in any of the outcome variables or in sputum transportability.10,11.
