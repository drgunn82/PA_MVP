DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Cysteamine ophthalmic solution, a cystine-depleting agent, is indicated for the
treatment of corneal cystine crystal accumulation in patients with
cystinosis.1,2
Disease Overview
Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism in which cystine
accumulates within lysosomes and forms crystals in many tissues, including the
kidneys, liver, bone marrow, pancreas, muscle, rectal mucosa, brain, and eye.3
Cystine deposits in the cornea cause photophobia. Patients may present only with
corneal crystal deposition but no associated systemic manifestations; the kidney,
retina, and other organs are free of cystine accumulation in these patients. In
patients without systemic symptoms, diagnosis of ocular cystinosis is often in
adulthood when corneal crystal deposits are noted on ocular examination.4 Of note,
with oral cysteamine the concentration obtained in corneal tissue is inadequate and

does not affect corneal cystine crystals. Topical treatment is required to dissolve
existing cystine crystals.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of cysteamine
ophthalmic solution. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with cysteamine ophthalmic solution as well as the monitoring required for
adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires cysteamine ophthalmic
solution to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
