Authorization Policy

REVIEW DATE: 05/07/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Cerdelga, a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, is indicated for the long-term
treatment of Gaucher disease type 1, in adults who are cytochrome P450 2D6
extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, or poor metabolizers as detected
by an FDA-cleared test.1
Disease Overview
Gaucher disease is caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme β-
glucocerebrosidase.2 This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of
glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide. In Gaucher disease, deficiency of the
enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase results in the accumulation of glucosylceramide
substrate in the lysosomal compartment of macrophages, giving rise to foam cells or
“Gaucher cells.” Cerdelga is a specific inhibitor of the enzyme glycosylceramide

synthase, which is responsible for producing the substrate glucosylceramide; hence
Cerdelga functions as a substrate reduction therapy.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Cerdelga. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Cerdelga as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Cerdelga to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated.
• Cerdelga® (eliglustat capsules (Genzyme)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Gaucher Disease Type 1. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of the
following (A, B, and C):
A) Patient is a cytochrome P450 2D6 extensive metabolizer, intermediate
metabolizer, or poor metabolizer as detected by an approved test; AND
B) The diagnosis is established by ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Demonstration of deficient beta-glucocerebrosidase activity in leukocytes
or fibroblasts; OR
ii. Molecular genetic test documenting biallelic pathogenic glucocerebrosidase
(GBA) gene variants; AND
C) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a geneticist,
endocrinologist, metabolic disorder subspecialist, or a physician who
specializes in the treatment of Gaucher disease or related disorders.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Cerdelga® (eliglustat capsules (Genzyme)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concomitant Use with Other Approved Therapies for Gaucher Disease.
Concomitant use with other treatments approved for Gaucher disease has not
been evaluated. Of note, examples of medications approved for Gaucher disease
include Cerezyme (imiglucerase intravenous infusion), Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa
intravenous infusion), Vpriv (velaglucerase alfa intravenous infusion), and
Zavesca (miglustat capsules).
