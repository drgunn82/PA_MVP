THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES

CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Linezolid (Zyvox) and Sivextro are synthetic oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents.1,2
Both agents have clinical utility in the treatment of infections caused by aerobic
Gram-positive bacteria. Cross-resistance between linezolid or Sivextro and other
classes of antibiotics is unlikely because the mechanism of action for both of these
agents differs from that of other antibacterial agents.
Linezolid is indicated in adults and children for the treatment of the following
infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms:1
• Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), caused by Streptococcus
pneumoniae, including cases with concurrent bacteremia, or Staphylococcus
aureus (methicillin-susceptible [MSSA] only);
• Complicated skin and skin structure infections (SSTIs), including
diabetic foot infections, without concomitant osteomyelitis caused by S.
aureus (MSSA and methicillin-resistant [MRSA]), Streptococcus pyogenes, or
Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid has not been studied in the treatment of
decubitus ulcers;
• Nosocomial pneumonia, caused by S. aureus (MSSA and MRSA) or S.
pneumoniae;
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Antibiotics – Linezolid (Zyvox), Sivextro Prior
Authorization Policy
• Uncomplicated SSTIs, caused by S. aureus (MSSA only) or S. pyogenes;
• Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, including cases
with concurrent bacteremia.
Limitation of Use: Linezolid is not indicated for the treatment of Gram-negative
infections. It is crucial that specific Gram-negative therapy be initiated immediately
if a concomitant Gram-negative pathogen is documented or suspected. The safety
and efficacy of linzezolid given longer than 28 days have not been evaluated in
controlled clinical trials.
Sivextro is indicated for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin
structure infections (ABSSSI) that are caused by susceptible isolates of the
following Gram-positive microorganisms: S. aureus (MRSA and MSSA), S.
pyogenes, S. agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus Group (including S. anginosus,
Streptococcus intermedius, and Streptococcus constellatus), and Enterococcus
faecalis in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age.2
Although linezolid and Sivextro are indicated for the treatment of infections caused
by susceptible strains of MSSA and drug-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae in some
situations, these agents are not the optimal drug or drugs of first-choice for these
microorganisms.3,4 Other antibiotics may be used. In efforts to reduce the
development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of linezolid and
Sivextro, both antibiotics should be used only to treat infections that are proven or
strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.1,2 When culture and
susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or
modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology
and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.
Guidelines
Linezolid and Sivextro are addressed in a number of guidelines from the Infectious
Diseases Society of America (IDSA):
• Diabetic Foot Infections: A clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and
treatment of diabetic foot infections (2023) notes that diabetic foot infections
of moderate severity may be treated with oral or initial parenteral therapy,
whereas severe infections should be treated with parenteral therapy.6
Linezolid, Cubicin® (daptomycin injection), doxycycline, clindamycin,
fluoroquinolones and intravenous (IV) vancomycin are listed as therapy
options for infections caused by MRSA.
• Infective Endocarditis: Treatment guidelines, from the American Heart
Association and endorsed by IDSA (2015), recommend linezolid as a
treatment option for patients with infective endocarditis caused by
Enterococcus species that is resistant to penicillin, aminoglycosides, and
vancomycin.9
• MRSA: Guidelines (2011) for the treatment of MRSA infections recognize
linezolid as a treatment option for infections, including those involving the
central nervous system (e.g., meningitis, brain abscess), osteomyelitis, and
septic arthritis.5
6 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Antibiotics – Linezolid (Zyvox), Sivextro Prior
Authorization Policy
• Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis: Treatment guidelines from the World
Health Organization (2022) recommend linezolid to be used in combination
with Pretomanid and Sirturo (bedaquiline tablets) for 6 to 9 months for the
treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis or rifampin-resistant
tuberculosis.10
• Pneumonia: Guidelines from the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and IDSA
(2016) recommend that MRSA hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) or
ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) be treated with either vancomycin or
linezolid rather than other antibiotics or other antibiotic combinations.4 The
choice between vancomycin and linezolid may be guided by patient-specific
factors such as blood cell counts, concurrent prescriptions for serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, renal function, and cost. The available evidence
indicates that vancomycin and linezolid are roughly similar and no alternative
agent or regimen is clearly superior to these two products. Guidelines from
IDSA/ATS (2019) for CAP recommend vancomycin or linezolid for the
treatment of community-acquired MRSA.3 In addition, the Pediatric
Infectious Diseases Society and IDSA guidelines (2011) for the treatment of
CAP in infants and children > 3 months of age recommend linezolid as an
alternative to vancomycin for treatment of MRSA, and as an alternative to
ceftriaxone for the treatment of S. pneumoniae resistant to penicillin.8
• SSTIs: Guidelines (2014) for the diagnosis and management of SSTIs
recommend oral antibiotics such as penicillin VK, cephalosporin, dicloxacillin,
and clindamycin for mild nonpurulent (i.e., necrotizing infection, cellulitis,
erysipelas) SSTIs.7 For moderate nonpurulent SSTI, IV antibiotics such as
penicillin, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, and clindamycin are recommended. For
moderate purulent SSTIs, empiric treatment can be started with
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) or doxycycline. For MRSA
infections, TMP/SMX is the recommended therapy. Cephalexin or dicloxacillin
are usually effective for MSSA infections. For severe purulent SSTI, empiric
therapy with IV vancomycin, Cubicin, linezolid, Vibativ® (telavancin
intravenous infusion), or Teflaro® (ceftaroline intravenous infusion) are
recommended. All of these agents are active against MRSA strains. For
severe purulent SSTIs caused by MSSA, therapy can be switched to nafcillin,
cefazolin, or clindamycin.
