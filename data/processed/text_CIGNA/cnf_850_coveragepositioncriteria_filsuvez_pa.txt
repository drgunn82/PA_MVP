CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Filsuvez is indicated for the treatment of wounds associated with dystrophic
epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) and junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) in patients
≥ 6 months of age.1
Filsuvez is a sterile botanical drug product for topical use and contains birch triterpenes in
an oil base. Birch triterpenes is a botanical drug substance composed of a mixture of
pentacyclic triterpenes. Filsuvez should be applied to cleansed wounds with wound dressing
changes until the wound is healed. If a Filsuvez-treated wound becomes infected, treatment
should be discontinued until the infection has resolved.
Disease Overview
DEB usually presents at birth and is divided into two major types depending on the pattern
of inheritance: recessive DEB (RDEB) and dominant DEB (DDEB).6 All subtypes of DEB are
caused by mutations in the gene coding COL7A1 leading to extreme skin fragility.4,6 The
hallmark of DEB is scarring of blisters, both on the skin and on other mucosal surfaces.4
JEB is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by skin blistering through the lamina
lucida of the cutaneous basement membrane zone.4 The severity varies across the two
major JEB subtypes, intermediate and severe, with severe disease causing death in the first
6 to 24 months of life. JEB is less common than DEB. Biallelic mutations in one of the three
genes encoding the subunit chains of laminin 332 (LAMA3,
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Dermatology – Filsuvez Prior Authorization Policy
LAMB3, LAMC2) can cause either JEB subtype, biallelic mutations of COL17A1 can also
cause intermediate JEB and rarely severe JEB. Rare JEB subtypes are clinically and
genetically heterogeneous
and include several syndromic disorders. Wounds in JEB are characterized as having
excessive granulation tissue, and frequently affect the face and occipital area, diaper area,
and extremities.6 Wounds may heal with pigment changes or with scarring. Other features
of JEB include extensive skin and mucous membrane involvement, failure to thrive and
sepsis in severe subtypes, nail dystrophy and loss, and hair loss in intermediate and
localized subtypes.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Filsuvez was evaluated in EASE, a Phase III, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multicenter, pivotal study in patients ≥ 21 days of age with inherited
DEB or JEB (n = 223).2,3 Patients who had undergone stem cell transplant or gene therapy
for the treatment of inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) were excluded. Additionally,
patients with current and/or former malignancy including basal cell carcinomas and
squamous cell carcinomas were ineligible to enroll.
The study consisted of a 90-day, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled treatment
phase (published), followed by a 24-month, open-label, single-arm, follow-up phase (data
unavailable).3 In the double-blind phase, patients were randomized 1:1 to Filsuvez or
placebo vehicle gel, both with standard of care wound dressing applied at least once every 4
days (treatment with Filsuvez or placebo was applied at the same time as the wound
dressing change). One EB target wound was assigned for each patient. The target wound
involved loss of the epidermis; extension into the dermis was allowed. The target wound
size was 10 cm2 to 50 cm2 in surface area and the age of the target wound was ≥ 21 days
but < 9 months according to the patient’s report. For the assessment of wound closure and
re-epithelization, the investigator photographed the target wound and all other wounds that
matched target wound criteria with a system that measures accurately, precisely, and
reliably to provide high quality imaging and standardized documentation. Post-treatment
assessments were made within 1 week of wound closure to determine the durability of
healing.
The median patient age was 12 years.2 The median wound size was 15.6 cm2 and the
median wound age was 35.5 days. Most patients had RDEB (78.5%); 9.0% of patients had
DDEB and 11.0% of patients had JEB. In the DDEB subgroup, there was an imbalance
between patients receiving Filsuvez (n = 6) and placebo (n = 14). Among patients with
RDEB, more than 55% had generalized-severe RDEB.
At Day 45 (± 7 days), 41.3% vs. 28.9% of patients receiving Filsuvez vs. placebo,
respectively, had complete wound closure (P = 0.013). However, a subgroup analysis by EB
subtype demonstrated that patients with RDEB (Filsuvez n = 91 and placebo n = 84) were
the only subgroup to have a statistically significant benefit from Filsuvez; complete target
wound closure by Day 45 was achieved in 44.0% of wounds treated with Filsuvez vs. 26.2%
of placebo-treated wounds (relative risk 1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14, 2.59; P
= 0.008). In patients with JEB (n = 26) and DDEB (n = 20), differences between Filsuvez
and placebo groups did not reach statistical significance (18.6% vs. 26.7%, respectively, in
JEB and 50% vs. 50%, respectively, in DDEB), although number of patients in each group
were small. At Day 90, the difference in time to first target wound closure was not
significantly different between the Filsuvez and placebo arms (50.5% vs. 43.9%,
respectively). Differences in total wound burden were not statistically different between
Filsuvez and placebo. There were improvements in the Itch Man Scale (patients ≥ 4 years of
4 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Dermatology – Filsuvez Prior Authorization Policy
age) with both Filsuvez and placebo (a significant difference with Filsuvez was only observed
at Day 60).2 There was a statistically significant reduction in procedural pain with Filsuvez
vs. placebo at Days 14 and 90 only, not at other timepoints (Day 30, Day 45, and Day 60).
In an analysis of dressing change frequency, patients treated with Filsuvez had a reduced
requirement for daily dressing changes vs. placebo; at Day 90, this equated to one less
dressing change every 2 weeks with Filsuvez vs. no change with placebo.
Guidelines
Filsuvez is not addressed in available guidelines. According to a position statement by the
European Reference Network for Rare Skin Diseases (2021), wound care is the
cornerstone of treatment for patients with EB.5 Careful and complete skin and wound
assessment should be undertaken regularly, at least every 6 months. The healing rate of
chronic wounds should be closely monitored, by checking wound edges.
The diagnosis of EB is based on a combination of clinical features, family history, and
laboratory findings.5 Laboratory techniques include immunofluorescence mapping,
transmission electron microscopy, and molecular genetic testing. Whenever possible,
laboratory diagnosis should be performed in a specialized EB center. Genetic testing is the
gold standard for the diagnosis of EB, since it provides a definitive diagnosis and
classification of the major EB type and in many cases, the subtype.
An international consensus best practice guideline on skin and wound care in EB
[2017] notes that EB is a lifelong disease that requires specialist intervention and
consideration to minimize complications and improve quality of life.6 Management should
ideally take place in a specialized center by a multi-disciplinary team. Definitive diagnosis is
most commonly made from analysis of a skin biopsy using positive immunofluorescence,
antigenic mapping, and transmission electron microscopy. These key diagnostic tools help
confirm diagnosis and indicate the particular subtype of EB. Due to the rarity of expertise
and facilities, diagnosis is generally made using immunofluorescence and antigen mapping.
Some laboratories are moving towards molecular diagnosis from exome sequencing of a
panel of known skin fragility genes. Experienced clinicians can often make a provisional
diagnosis on clinical observations, but a definitive diagnosis will always be required.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Filsuvez. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Filsuvez as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires Filsuvez to
be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
Documentation: Documentation is required for use of Filsuvez as noted in the criteria as
[documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not limited to, chart notes,
prescription claims records, prescription receipts, and/or other information.
