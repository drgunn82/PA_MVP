INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Xolair, an anti-immunoglobulin (Ig)E monoclonal antibody, is indicated in the
following conditions:1
• Asthma, in patients ≥ 6 years of age with moderate to severe persistent
disease who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial
aeroallergen and whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with inhaled
corticosteroids (ICSs). Xolair has been shown to decrease the incidence of
asthma exacerbations in these patients. Limitations of Use: Xolair is not
indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. It is also
not indicated for the treatment of other allergic conditions.
• Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), in patients ≥ 12 years of age who
remain symptomatic despite H antihistamine treatment. Limitation of Use:
1
Xolair is not indicated for the treatment of other forms of urticaria.
• Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), as add-on
maintenance treatment in patients ≥ 18 years of age with an inadequate
response to nasal corticosteroids.
• IgE-mediated food allergy, in patients ≥ 1 year of age, for the reduction of
allergic reactions (Type I), including anaphylaxis, that may occur with
accidental exposure to one or more foods. Xolair is to be used in conjunction
Page 1 of 14 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Immunologicals – Xolair Drug Quantity Management
Policy – Per Days
with food allergen avoidance. Limitation of Use: Xolair is not indicated for the
emergency treatment of allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.
Dosing
Asthma
The recommended dose of Xolair for the treatment of asthma is 75 mg to 375 mg
administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection once every 2 weeks (Q2W) or once
every 4 weeks (Q4W) based on serum total IgE level measured before the start of
treatment and body weight.
CRSwNP
The recommended dose of Xolair for the treatment CRSwNP is 75 mg to 600 mg
administered as a SC injection Q2W or Q4W based on serum total IgE level measured
before the start of treatment and by body weight.
Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria
The recommended dose of Xolair for the treatment of CIU is 150 mg or 300 mg
administered as a SC injection Q4W. Dosing of Xolair in CIU patients is not dependent
on serum IgE level (free or total) or body weight.
IgE-Mediated Food Allergy
The recommended dose of Xolair for the treatment of food allergy is 75 mg to 600
mg administered as a SC injection Q2W or Q4W based on serum total IgE level
measured before the start of treatment and by body weight.
Availability
Xolair is available as 75 mg/0.5 mL, 150 mg/mL, and 300 mg/mL auto-injectors and
prefilled syringes.1 Each carton contains one auto-injector or syringe. It is also
available as 150 mg vials of lyophilized powder. Each carton contains one vial. The
prefilled syringes are labeled for patient or caregiver administration, while the vials
are labeled for healthcare provider administration only. The auto-injector (all
strengths) is labeled for use in patients ≥ 12 years of age only.
Tables 1 and 2 provide information on the number of auto-injectors/syringes or vials
that are needed to achieve each Xolair dose.

Early Annual Xolair 75 mg auto-injectors: New quantity limits of 2 auto-injectors 03/13/2024
Revision per 28 days at retail and 6 auto-injectors per 84 days at home delivery
were added to the policy. No clinical overrides apply.
Xolair 150 mg auto-injectors: New quantity limits of 2 auto-
injectors per 28 days at retail and 6 auto-injectors per 84 days at home
delivery were added to the policy. New override criteria were added to
approve the quantity listed in the table in Appendix A, if the patient is
requesting Xolair for the treatment of immunoglobulin (Ig)E-mediated
food allergy or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). The
table in Appendix A approves the following quantities:
• 3 auto-injectors per 28 days at retail and 9 auto-injectors per 84 days
at home delivery, if the patient requires a dose of 450 mg once every
4 weeks (Q4W) as determined by their weight and baseline IgE level.

Policy – Per Days
• 6 auto-injectors per 28 days at retail and 18 auto-injectors per 84
days at home delivery, if the patient requires a dose of 450 mg once
every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 525 mg Q2W as determined by their weight
and baseline IgE level.
Xolair 150 mg prefilled syringes: Existing quantity limits of 4
syringes per 28 days at retail and 12 syringes per 84 days at home
delivery were changed to 2 syringes per 28 days at retail and 6 syringes
per 28 days at home delivery. Override criteria were updated to
approve the quantity listed in the table in Appendix A, if the patient is
requesting Xolair for the treatment IgE-mediated food allergy or
CRSwNP. Previously, override criteria approved the quantity listed in
the table in Appendix A, if the patient was requesting Xolair for the
treatment of nasal polyps. The following changes were made to the
override quantities in the table in Appendix A:
• A new override was added for 3 prefilled syringes per 28 days at retail
and 9 prefilled syringes per 84 days at home delivery, if the patient
requires a dose of 450 mg Q4W as determined by their weight and
baseline IgE level.
• The override quantity for a patient who requires a dose of 525 mg
Q2W as determined by their weight and baseline IgE level was
updated to 6 prefilled syringes per 28 days at retail and 18 prefilled
syringes per 84 days at home delivery. Previously, this override
provided a quantity of 8 prefilled syringes per 28 days at retail and
24 prefilled syringes per 84 days at home delivery.
• The override for patients who require a dose of 600 mg Q2W as
determined by their weight and baseline IgE level was removed.
Previously, an override was provided for 8 prefilled syringes per 28
days at retail and 24 prefilled syringes per 84 days at home delivery.
Xolair 150 mg vials: Override criteria were updated to approve the
quantity listed in the table in Appendix B, if the patient is requesting
Xolair for the treatment IgE-mediated food allergy or CRSwNP.
Previously, override criteria approved the quantity listed in the table in
Appendix A, if the patient was requesting Xolair for the treatment of
nasal polyps. No changes were made to the table in Appendix B.
Xolair 300 mg auto-injectors and prefilled syringes: New
quantity limits of 2 auto-injectors per 28 days at retail and 6 auto-
injectors per 84 days at home delivery were added to the policy. New
override criteria were added to approve the quantity listed in the table
in Appendix C, if the patient is requesting Xolair for the treatment of
IgE-mediated food allergy or CRSwNP. The table in Appendix C
provides an approval of 4 auto-injectors/prefilled syringes per 28 days
at retail and 12 auto-injectors/prefilled syringes per 84 days at home
delivery, if the patient requires a dose of 600 mg Q2W as determined
by their weight and baseline IgE level.
