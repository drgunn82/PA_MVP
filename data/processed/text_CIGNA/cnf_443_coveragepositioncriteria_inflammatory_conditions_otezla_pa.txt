INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.

Otezla XR is indicated for the following uses:1
Page 1 of 9 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Otezla/Otezla XR Prior
Authorization Policy
• Behcet’s disease, in adults with oral ulcers.
• Plaque psoriasis, in adults who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic
therapy.
• Plaque psoriasis, in pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age and ≥ 50 kg with
moderate to severe disease who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic
therapy.
• Psoriatic arthritis, in adults with active disease.
• Psoriatic arthritis, in pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age and ≥ 50 kg with
active disease.
Guidelines
Otezla is addressed in guidelines for treatment of inflammatory conditions.
• Behcet’s Disease: Recommendations for the management of Behcet’s
disease from the European League Against Rheumatism (2018) mention
Otezla as a treatment option for Behcet’s disease with mucocutaneous
involvement.7 Other options include topical steroids, colchicine, azathioprine,
thalidomide, interferon alpha, and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis).
TNFis are also listed among the therapeutic options for patients who present
with eye involvement, refractory venous thrombosis, arterial involvement,
refractory/severe gastrointestinal involvement, nervous system involvement,
and/or joint involvement.
• Plaque Psoriasis: Joint guidelines from the American Academy of
Dermatology and National Psoriasis Medical Board (2020) have been
published for management of psoriasis with systemic non-biologic therapies.8
These guidelines list Otezla as a monotherapy treatment option for patients
with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. For treatment of moderate to
severe psoriasis in adults, Otezla has a similar level of evidence and strength
of recommendation as methotrexate. Additionally, data support use of
methotrexate in combination with other systemic therapies for psoriasis,4,8
whereas there is no strong evidence supporting combination use of Otezla
with other systemic therapies or with phototherapy.4 Pediatric guidelines
were published by the American Academy of Dermatology and the National
Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) [2020].11 These guidelines list traditional
systemic therapies (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin) and biologics
as options for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. There was
insufficient data in pediatric patients to make recommendations for Otezla.
• Psoriatic Arthritis: Guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology
(2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics and Otezla for use in
treatment-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis and in those who were
previously treated with an oral therapy.6
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Otezla. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Otezla as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
Page 2 of 9 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Otezla/Otezla XR Prior
Authorization Policy
requires Otezla to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Otezla® (apremilast tablets – Amgen)
• Otezla XR™ (apremilast extended-release tablets – Amgen)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Otezla® (apremilast tablets – Amgen)
• Otezla XR™ (apremilast extended-release tablets – Amgen)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Ankylosing Spondylitis. Current evidence does not support use of
Otezla/Otezla XR in ankylosing spondylitis. In a published, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, Phase III study, patients (n = 490) were randomized in a
1:1:1 ratio to treatment with Otezla 30 mg twice daily, Otezla 20 mg twice
daily, or placebo.9 At Week 16, the change from baseline in the primary
endpoint (Assessment of the Spondyloarthritis international Society 20
[ASAS20] response), was not statistically significantly different between the
Otezla and placebo groups.
2. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination
with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used
for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination
therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of
adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Page 5 of 9 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Otezla/Otezla XR Prior
Authorization Policy
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in
combination with this medication.
3. Rheumatoid Arthritis. Current evidence does not support use of Otezla/Otezla
XR in rheumatoid arthritis. A multicenter, double-blind, Phase II study (n =
237) randomized patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with Otezla 20 mg twice
daily, Otezla 30 mg twice daily, or placebo.10 All patients were required to take
a stable dose of methotrexate throughout the study. At Week 16, a similar
proportion of patients in all treatment groups achieved an American College of
Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response (28%, 34%, and 35%, respectively). At Week
16, patients who were non-responders, defined as patients with a swollen joint
count and tender joint count that had not improved by at least 20%, were
required to enter early escape (patients who were receiving placebo were
transitioned to Otezla 20 mg twice daily and patients receiving Otezla continued
on the assigned therapy for an additional year). At Week 24, all patients who
received placebo were similarly transitioned to Otezla. At Weeks 24 and 52,
both doses of Otezla were associated with generally similar changes versus
placebo, including ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70. A subset of patients underwent
magnetic resonance imaging evaluation; however, no significant difference in
response rate was observed at Week 16. The study was terminated early; data
were not analyzed at Year 2 as originally planned.
