CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Adalimumab products are tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) approved for the
following uses:1
• Ankylosing spondylitis, for reducing signs and symptoms in adults with
active disease.
• Crohn’s disease, for treatment of moderately to severely active disease in
patients ≥ 6 years of age.
• Hidradenitis suppurativa, for the treatment of moderate to severe disease
in patients ≥ 12 years of age.
• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), ± methotrexate for reducing signs and
symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular disease in patients ≥
2 years of age.
• Plaque psoriasis, for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe chronic
disease who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and when
other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate.
• Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ± conventional synthetic disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), for reducing the signs and symptoms of active
arthritis, inhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving
physical function in adults with active disease.
• Rheumatoid arthritis, ± methotrexate or other conventional synthetic
DMARDS to reduce the signs and symptoms, induce major clinical response,
inhibit the progression of structural damage, and improve physical function in
adults with moderately to severely active disease.
• Ulcerative colitis, for treatment of moderately to severely active disease in
patients ≥ 5 years of age. However, efficacy has not been established in
patients with ulcerative colitis who have lost response or were intolerant to
another TNFi.
• Uveitis, in patients ≥ 2 years of age with noninfectious intermediate,
posterior, and panuveitis.
Guidelines
TNFis are featured prominently in guidelines for treatment of inflammatory
conditions.
• Ankylosing Spondylitis and Spondyloarthritis: Guidelines for ankylosing
spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondylitis are published by the
American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of
America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (2019).3 TNFis
are recommended as the initial biologic. In those who are secondary non-
Page 2 of 21: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions -
Adalimumab Products Prior Authorization Policy
responders to a TNFi, a second TNFi is recommended over switching out of the
class.
• Crohn’s Disease: The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) [2025]
has guidelines for the management of CD in adults.4 In moderate to severe
disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be utilized for
induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended include TNFis,
Entyvio® (vedolizumab), interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, and
Rinvoq® (upadacitinib). If steroids are utilized for induction, efforts should be
made to introduce steroid-sparing agents for maintenance therapy. Guidelines
from the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [2021] include TNFis
among the therapies for moderate to severe Crohn’s disease, for induction and
maintenance of remission.17
• Hidradenitis Suppurativa: North American guidelines (2019) recommend
consideration of adalimumab (level A strength of recommendation, level 1
evidence) for those with moderate to severe disease who do not respond to
conventional therapy.19
• JIA: There are guidelines from ACR and the Arthritis Foundation for the
treatment of JIA (2021) which address oligoarthritis and temporomandibular
joint (TMJ) arthritis. For oligoarthritis, a biologic is recommended following a
trial of a conventional synthetic DMARD.6 In patients with TMJ arthritis,
scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or intra-
articular glucocorticoids are recommended first-line. A biologic is a therapeutic
option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid
escalation to a biologic ± conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate
preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ
arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be
initiated for JIA. ACR guidelines (2019) are also available specifically for
juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.5 TNFis are the
biologics recommended for polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics
are recommended following other therapies (e.g., following DMARDs for active
polyarthritis or following an NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis).
However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be
preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g., if there is involvement of
high-risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity;
and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint damage).
• Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists
and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend adalimumab as a
monotherapy treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.7
• PsA: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over other biologics for
use in treatment-naïve patients with PsA and in those who were previously
treated with an oral therapy.8
• Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of
a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum
tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.2
• Ulcerative Colitis: The AGA (2024) and ACG (2025) have clinical practice
guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in
adults.9,10 In moderate to severe disease, systemic corticosteroids or
Page 3 of 21: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions -
Adalimumab Products Prior Authorization Policy
advanced therapies may be utilized for induction of remission. Advanced
therapies recommended include TNFis, Entyvio, IL-23 inhibitors, IL-12/23
inhibitors, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, and Janus
kinase (JAK) inhibitors. If steroids are utilized for induction, efforts should be
made to introduce steroid-sparing agents for maintenance therapy. Of note,
guidelines state corticosteroids may be avoided entirely when other effective
induction strategies are planned.10 Both guidelines also recommend that any
drug that effectively treats induction should be continued for maintenance.9,10
• Uveitis and Ocular Inflammatory Disorders: American Academy of
Ophthalmology (AAO) guidelines (2014) note that adalimumab may be used
in patients with uveitis due to various causes (e.g., spondyloarthropathy-
associated or human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-B27-associated uveitis, JIA-
associated uveitis, and other posterior uveitides and panuveitis syndromes).12
Adalimumab should be considered second-line in vision-threatening JIA-
associated uveitis when methotrexate has failed or is not tolerated (strong
recommendation) and may be used as corticosteroid-sparing treatment for
vision-threatening chronic uveitis from seronegative spondyloarthropathy
(strong recommendation). Adalimumab may also be considered in other
patients who have vision-threatening or corticosteroid-dependent disease who
have failed first-line therapies. Adalimumab should be considered as a second-
line immunomodulatory agent for severe ocular inflammatory conditions
including chronic and severe scleritis. This was re-affirmed in separate
guidelines (2018) for non-corticosteroid systemic immunomodulatory therapy
in noninfectious uveitis.20 ACR/Arthritis Federation guidelines (2019) for
uveitis associated with JIA make recommendations for use of conventional
systemic DMARDs and biologics. In patients with severe active chronic anterior
uveitis associated with sight-threatening complications, a TNFi (monoclonal
antibody) + methotrexate is recommended.19
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
There are guidelines and/or published data supporting the use of adalimumab
products in the following conditions:
• Behcet’s Disease: The European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR)
recommendations (2018) include TNFis for initial or recurrent sight-
threatening uveitis.13 For patients refractory to first-line treatments (e.g.,
corticosteroids), TNFis are among the treatment options for mucocutaneous
manifestations, venous thrombosis, severe or refractory gastrointestinal
disease, and recurrent/chronic joint involvement. Recommendations for the
use of TNFis in ocular inflammatory disorders from the AAO (2014) note that
TNFis may be used first-line in patients with ophthalmic manifestations of
Behcet’s disease and for acute exacerbations of preexisting Behcet’s disease.12
• Pyoderma Gangrenosum: Although guidelines are not current, multiple
topical and systemic therapies have been used for pyoderma gangrenosum.
Oral prednisone is the most common initial immunosuppressant medication.14
Other systemic therapies include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine,
cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and TNFis (i.e., infliximab,
Page 4 of 21: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions -
Adalimumab Products Prior Authorization Policy
etanercept, and adalimumab products). In case reports, TNFis have been
effective.
• Sarcoidosis: According to European Respiratory Society guidelines for
sarcoidosis (2021), a TNFi is recommended after a trial of glucocorticoids and
immunosuppressants for pulmonary and neurosarcoidosis.15
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of adalimumab
products. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where
the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
adalimumab products as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-
term efficacy, initial approval requires the agent to be prescribed by or in consultation
with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
