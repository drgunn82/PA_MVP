CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Cosentyx subcutaneous, an interleukin (IL)-17A antagonist, is indicated in the
following conditions:1
• Enthesitis-related arthritis, in patients ≥ 4 years of age with active disease.
• Hidradenitis suppurativa, in adults with moderate to severe disease.
• Plaque psoriasis, in patients ≥ 6 years of age with moderate to severe
disease who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
• Psoriatic arthritis, in patients ≥ 2 years of age with active disease.
• Ankylosing spondylitis, in adults with active disease.
• Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, in adults with active disease and
objective signs of inflammation.
In the pivotal trial for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, patients were required
to have objective signs of inflammation, indicated by elevated C-reactive protein
and/or sacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging.
Guidelines
Il-17 blockers are mentioned in multiple guidelines for treatment of inflammatory
conditions.
Page 1 of 12 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Cosentyx Subcutaneous
Prior Authorization Policy
• Enthesitis-Related Arthritis: Guidelines for juvenile idiopathic arthritis from
the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [2018] address treatment of
enthesitis-related arthritis.14 These recommendations were developed prior to
approval of Cosentyx. A tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) is recommended
over use of methotrexate or sulfasalazine in those who have tried a
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).
• Plaque Psoriasis: Joint guidelines of care for the management and treatment
of psoriasis with biologics were published by the American Academy of
Dermatology (AAD) and the National Psoriasis Foundation (2019).3 All of the
biologics are generally recommended for treatment of moderate to severe
disease. The AAD also recommends methotrexate (unless contraindicated)
and other systemic therapies for treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.4
Traditional systemic agents can benefit widespread psoriasis. Studies have
assessed response to methotrexate following 6 weeks to 4 months of
treatment.
• Psoriatic Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR/National Psoriasis Foundation
(2018) generally recommend TNFis as the first-line treatment strategy over
other biologics (e.g., IL-17 blockers) with differing mechanisms of action.5
• Ankylosing Spondylitis and Non-Radiographic Axial Apondyloarthritis:
Guidelines for ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial
spondyloarthritis are published by the ACR/Spondylitis Association of
America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (2019).2
Following primary nonresponse to a TNFi, either Cosentyx or Taltz®
(ixekizumab injection) is recommended; however, if the patient is a secondary
nonresponder, a second TNFi is recommended over switching out of the class.
In patients with a contraindication to a TNFi, use of an IL-17 blocker is
recommended over traditional oral agents such as methotrexate or
sulfasalazine.

Authorization Policy
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Cosentyx
subcutaneous. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases
where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because
of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Cosentyx subcutaneous as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and
long-term efficacy, initial approval requires Cosentyx subcutaneous to be prescribed
by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR APPROVAL
• Cosentyx® (secukinumab subcutaneous injection – Novartis)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination
with this medication.
2. Crohn’s Disease. Exacerbations of Crohn’s disease, in some cases serious,
occurred in clinical trials in patients treated with Cosentyx.1 In a Phase II
published study in patients with Crohn’s disease (n = 59), an intravenous
formulation of Cosentyx did not reduce the Crohn’s disease activity index by ≥ 50
points compared with placebo and the study was terminated prematurely.6
3. Rheumatoid Arthritis. In a published, double-dummy Phase III study, Cosentyx
was less effective than current treatments in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Cosentyx Subcutaneous Prior
Authorization Policy
who were previously treated with a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi).7
Patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: 1) induction with an
intravenous formulation of Cosentyx (10 mg/kg) followed by Cosentyx 150 mg
subcutaneously given once every 4 weeks (Q4W) [n = 137]; 2) secukinumab
intravenous induction (10 mg/kg) followed by Cosentyx 75 mg subcutaneously
Q4W (n = 138). At Week 24, ACR 20 response was significantly better with
Cosentyx 150 mg subcutaneous (31%) vs. placebo (18%). ACR 20 response with
Cosentyx 75 mg was 28%, which was not significantly better than the placebo
group. ACR 50/70 responses were 17%/10%, respectively, with Cosentyx 150
mg and 12%/5%, respectively, with Cosentyx 75 mg which were not significantly
different from that of placebo (9%/5%, respectively). The group treated with
Orencia intravenous had significantly improved ACR 50/70 responses at Week 24
(28%/12%). Using as observed data, ACR 20/50/70 responses at Week 52 were
63%/46%/19%, respectively, with Cosentyx 150 mg, 57%/26%/7%,
respectively, with Cosentyx 75 mg, and 75%/52%/23%, respectively, with
Orencia intravenous. There is a published Phase II dose-ranging study (n = 237)
evaluating Cosentyx in rheumatoid arthritis.8-10 The ACR 20 response at Week 16
(using last observation carried forward analysis) was 34%, 46.9%, 46.5%, 53.7%
for the 25, 75, 150, and 300 mg doses, respectively, vs. 36% for placebo;
however, this did not achieve statistical significance. After Week 16, patients who
responded to Cosentyx had sustained response through Week 52, with patients
on the 150 mg dose having the greatest improvement over time (55% and 40%
of patients with ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses, respectively, at Week 52). In
another Phase II study, Cosentyx did not achieve higher ACR 20 response rates
at Week 12 vs. placebo.11 There was an open-label treatment period where ACR
responses were generally maintained through Week 52. Some patients were
treated with an intravenous formulation of secukinumab and generally responded
similarly to those treated with Cosentyx. In another Phase II study, an
intravenous formulation of secukinumab demonstrated limited efficacy in biologic-
naïve patients with rheumatoid arthritis associated with the HLA-DRB1 allele.12
4. Uveitis. Efficacy is not established for this condition. There was not a statistically
significant difference between Cosentyx subcutaneous and placebo in three Phase
III studies that included patients with Behcet’s uveitis (n = 118); active,
noninfectious, non-Behcet’s uveitis (n = 31); and quiescent, noninfectious, non-
Behcet’s uveitis (n = 125) [SHEILD, INSURE, and ENDURE studies,
respectively].13
