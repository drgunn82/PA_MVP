INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.

Off-Label Dosing
There are data and/or guidelines to support several off-label uses of famciclovir.
Quantity limits for famciclovir provide for 21 tablets per dispensing at retail or 63
tablets per dispensing at home delivery for the 125 mg and 500 mg tablets. The
quantity limits for the famciclovir 250 mg tablets provide for 60 tablets per
dispensing at retail or 180 tablets per dispensing at home delivery. This provides a
quantity sufficient for the majority of labeled and off-label doses. Below are
situations where additional quantities of famciclovir may be needed.
• Herpes simplex virus (HSV): In adults and adolescents with HIV, famciclovir
500 mg BID is recommended for chronic suppression of HSV.2 Valacyclovir 500
mg BID is also recommended for HSV prophylaxis in immunocompromised
patients who have undergone solid organ transplant who are not already
receiving CMV prophylaxis.3 In this same population in patients with severe
mucocutaneous HSV, after initial intravenous (IV) therapy, oral therapy can be
used as oral lesions begin to regress (famciclovir 500 mg BID continued until
lesions are completely healed).
• Herpes zoster (shingles): In adults and adolescents with HIV, guidelines
recommend famciclovir 500 mg TID for 7 to 10 days (or longer if lesions are
slow to resolve) for the treatment of acute, localized, dermatomal herpes zoster
(shingles).2
• Varicella zoster virus (VZV) [chickenpox]: In adults and adolescents with HIV,
guidelines recommend famciclovir TID for 5 to 7 days for the treatment of
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Antivirals – Famciclovir Drug Quantity Management Policy
– Per Rx
uncomplicated cases of primary varicella infection (chickenpox).2 For severe or
complicated cases, patients are treated with IV therapy and are then
transitioned to oral therapy with famciclovir 500 mg TID after defervescence if
no evidence of visceral involvement is notes is noted.
• Viral ophthalmic infections: Famciclovir dosed TID is recommended for the
treatment of viral ocular infections, including acute retinal necrosis, an
ophthalmic reactivation of herpes zoster virus, following initial IV antiviral
treatment.2,4,5
