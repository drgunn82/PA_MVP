INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Indication
Kineret, an interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist, indicated for the following
uses:1
• Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) for treatment of
neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID).
• Deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA).
• Rheumatoid arthritis, to reduce the signs and symptoms and slow the
progression of structural damage in adults with moderately to severely active
disease who have failed one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
(DMARDs) given ± DMARDs other than tumor necrosis factor inhibitors
(TNFis).
Dosing
Kineret is administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection.1 A new syringe must be
used for each dose. The graduated syringes allow for partial doses between 20 mg
and 100 mg to be given. Any unused portion after each dose should be discarded.
Regardless of indication, consider administration of the prescribed dose every other

Management Policy – Per Days
day for patients who have severe renal insufficiency or end stage renal disease
(defined as creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, as estimated from serum creatinine
levels).
• CAPS: 1 to 2 mg per kg once daily (QD) for patients with NOMID. The dose
may be individually adjusted to a maximum of 8 mg per kg daily to control
active inflammation. Adjust doses in 0.5 to 1 mg per kg increments. QD
dosing is generally recommended, but dose may be split into twice daily
administration.
• DIRA: 1 to 2 mg per kg QD. The dose may be individually adjusted to a
maximum of 8 mg per kg QD to control active inflammation. Adjust doses in
0.5 to 1 mg per kg increments.
• Rheumatoid arthritis: 100 mg QD at approximately the same time every
day. Higher doses did not result in a higher response.
Off-Label Use
In addition to the FDA-approved uses, guidelines support the use of Kineret for the
treatment of systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) and Still’s disease.2-9
Dosing of Kineret for the treatment of SJIA and Still’s disease varies based on
reference, but guidelines support a dose of 4 mg per kg per day. However, higher
doses may be needed. Kineret has also been granted Emergency Use Authorization
for treatment of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in hospitalized adults with
positive viral testing with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-
flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to severe respiratory failure and likely
to have an elevated plasma soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor
(suPAR).10 The FDA recommends a dose of 100 mg SC QD for 10 days. In patients
with a creatinine clearance < 30 mL consider a dose of 100 mg SC every other day
for 5 total doses over 10 days.
Availability
Kineret is available as a 100 mg/0.67 mL prefilled syringes.1
POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to promote the safe,
effective, and economic use of Kineret and to manage potential premature dose
escalation. If the Drug Quantity Management rule is not met for the requested
medication at the point of service, coverage will be determined by the Criteria
below. All approvals are provided for 1 year in duration, unless otherwise noted
below.

criteria is(are) met. Any other exception is considered not medically
necessary.
CRITERIA
1. If the patient has cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) or deficiency
of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), approve a quantity sufficient to
allow for a dose of up to 8 mg per kg per day for 28 days at retail or for 84 days
at home delivery.
Note: CAPS encompasses three rare genetic syndromes: familial cold
autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), and
neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) or chronic infantile
neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA). Refer to the table
below for the maximum quantities that may be approved based on the patient’s
weight. When the patient is in between two weights provided, use the higher
weight to ensure an adequate quantity is approved.
