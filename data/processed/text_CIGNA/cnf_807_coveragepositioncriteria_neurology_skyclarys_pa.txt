INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Skyclarys, a nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) activator, is indicated
for the treatment of Friedreich’s ataxia in patients ≥ 16 years of age.1
Disease Overview
Friedreich’s ataxia is an autosomal recessive, progressive, neurodegenerative
disorder.2-6 In the setting of clinical suspicion due to symptoms (e.g., ataxia,
cardiomyopathy, scoliosis, and/or diabetes), genetic testing is the cornerstone of
confirming a diagnosis of Friedreich’s ataxia. A trinucleotide repeat expansion assay
to detect biallelic mutations is used.
Clinical Efficacy
In the pivotal study of Skyclarys, patients were 16 to 40 years of age with genetically
confirmed Friedreich’s ataxia.1,7 They were required to have a baseline modified
Friedreich’s Ataxia Rating Scale (mFARS) between 20 and 80. Patients with pes cavus
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Neurology – Skyclarys Prior Authorization Policy
were allowed to enroll in the study, but their participation was limited to 20% of
patients and the primary efficacy analysis did not include patients with pes cavus.
Patients with a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) > 200 pg/mL or a left ventricular
ejection fraction < 40% were also excluded from the study. Uncontrolled diabetes
mellitus, defined in a non-pivotal study as a hemoglobin A1c (HbA ) > 11%, was
1c
also part of the exclusion criteria for the pivotal trial.7,8 The vast majority of patients
enrolled in the pivotal trial were ambulatory (93%). The primary efficacy was
measured using the mFARS.
Guidelines
Available consensus guidelines on Friedreich’s ataxia (2022) identify Skyclarys as a
potential investigative agent, but do not make any specific recommendations
regarding its use.6 According to guidelines, patients with Friedreich’s ataxia should
have an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiogram at diagnosis and then at
least annually. Patients should also be evaluated annually for diabetes mellitus. There
is no cure for Friedreich’s ataxia; guidelines make extensive recommendations
regarding management of the symptoms and complications related to the disease,
including diabetes mellitus and cardiomyopathy.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Skyclarys.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Skyclarys as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Skyclarys to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated. All reviews will be forwarded to the Medical
Director for evaluation.
Documentation: Documentation is required where noted in the criteria as
[documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not limited to,
chart notes, laboratory tests, claims records, and/or other information. Subsequent
coverage reviews for a patient who has previously met the documentation
requirements and related criteria in the Neurology – Skyclarys Prior Authorization
Policy through the Coverage Review Department, and who is requesting
reauthorization, the criteria utilized do NOT require re-submission of documentation
for reauthorization, except for the criterion requiring documentation of the
trinucleotide repeat expansion assay genetic test confirming the diagnosis of
Friedreich’s ataxia.

as demonstrated by a slowed progression on the modified Friedreich’s
Ataxia Rating Scale; AND

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Skyclarys® (omaveloxolone capsules - Reata/Biogen)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Metastatic Melanoma. Skyclarys has also been evaluated for the treatment of
metastatic melanoma (in combination with Opdivo® [nivolumab intravenous
infusion] or Yervoy® [ipilimumab intravenous infusion]).9 Results have not been
published. More data are needed.

2. Mitochondrial Myopathy. Skyclarys has also been evaluated for the treatment
of mitochondrial myopathies. In one Phase II study, following 12 weeks of
therapy, no differences in peak workload or 6 minute walk test were observed
with Skyclarys vs. placebo.10 More data are needed to evaluate the efficacy and
safety of Skyclarys for mitochondrial myopathy.
