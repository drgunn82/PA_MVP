INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Cinacalcet, a calcium-sensing receptor agonist (calcimimetic), is indicated for the
following uses:1
• Hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma in adults.
• Hypercalcemia with primary hyperparathyroidism in adults for whom
parathyroidectomy would be indicated on the basis of serum calcium levels,
but who are unable to undergo parathyroidectomy.
• Secondary hyperparathyroidism with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
adults on dialysis.
Limitation of use: Cinacalcet is not indicated for use in patients with CKD who
are not on dialysis due to increased risk of hypocalcemia.
Disease Overview
Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a frequent complication of CKD caused by a
reduction in circulating calcitriol levels and disturbances in calcium and phosphorous
metabolism.2 This leads to increases in the parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, which
then leads to osteoclastic activity resulting in bone resorption and marrow fibrosis.
Parathyroid carcinoma, a rare malignant cancer, is an uncommon cause of primary
hyperparathyroidism.3 The condition is associated with higher serum calcium and
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Cinacalcet Prior Authorization Policy
PTH levels than primary hyperparathyroidism due to benign adenoma. The primary
cause of morbidity in patients with parathyroid carcinoma is due to complications of
hypercalcemia (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias, renal failure). Surgical resection of the
malignancy may relieve symptoms and reduce serum calcium levels. Medical therapy
with cinacalcet and intravenous bisphosphonates are useful adjunct therapies to
control hypercalcemia.
Guidelines
The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines
(2009; updated 2017) for the treatment of CKD-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD)
consider calcimimetics (cinacalcet), calcitriol, or vitamin D analogs (or a combination
of these agents) as reasonable first-line options for patients with CKD stage 5D who
require PTH-lowering therapy.4,5 If intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels fall
below two times the upper limit of normal for the assay, these products should be
reduced or discontinued.
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
The KDIGO clinical practice guidelines (2017) for the treatment of CKD-MBD note
that although cinacalcet is not approved for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism in
kidney transplant recipients, it is used in these patients, especially those with
significant hypercalcemia.4,5
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of cinacalcet. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with cinacalcet as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
cinacalcet to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated.
• Sensipar® (cinacalcet tablets – Amgen, generic)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Hypercalcemia due to Parathyroid Carcinoma. Approve for 1 year if
cinacalcet is prescribed by or in consultation with an oncologist or endocrinologist.
2. Hypercalcemia in a Patient with Primary Hyperparathyroidism. Approve for
1 year if the patient meets BOTH of the following (A and B):
A) Patient has failed or is unable to undergo a parathyroidectomy due to a
contraindication; AND
B) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a nephrologist or
endocrinologist.

3. Secondary Hyperparathyroidism. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL
of the following (A, B, C, and D):
A) Patient has chronic kidney disease; AND
B) Patient is on dialysis; AND
C) The baseline (prior to starting cinacalcet therapy) intact parathyroid hormone
(iPTH) level is at least two times the upper limit of normal as defined by the
laboratory reference value measured on two separate occasions; AND
D) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a nephrologist or
endocrinologist.
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
4. Hyperparathyroidism in a Post-Renal Transplant Patient. Approve for 1 year
if the patient meets BOTH of the following (A and B):
A) The baseline (prior to starting cinacalcet therapy) calcium and intact
parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels are above the normal range, as defined by
the laboratory reference values; AND
B) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a transplant physician,
nephrologist, or endocrinologist.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Sensipar® (cinacalcet tablets – Amgen, generic)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Patient with Primary Hyperparathyroidism Eligible for
Parathyroidectomy. Parathyroidectomy is the primary treatment for primary
hyperparathyroidism.
