DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
The Omnipod® Insulin Management System, Omnipod DASH® Insulin Management
System, Omnipod® 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System, and the Omnipod GO™
Insulin Delivery Device are subcutaneous (SC) insulin delivery systems.1-4
• The Omnipod Insulin Management System is intended for SC delivery of
insulin at set and variable rates for the management of diabetes mellitus
(DM) in persons requiring insulin and for the quantitative measurement of
glucose in fresh capillary whole blood (in vitro) from the finger.1
• Omnipod DASH Insulin Management System is intended for SC delivery of
insulin at set and variable rates (basal and bolus) for the management of DM
in persons requiring insulin.2 Omnipod DASH is indicated for patients of all
ages with either Type 1 or Type 2 DM. Omnipod DASH is interoperable with
a compatible blood glucose meter to receive and display blood glucose
measurements.

Policy – Per Days
• Omnipod 5 Automated Insulin Delivery System is intended for the SC
delivery of insulin, at set and variable rates (basal and bolus), for the
management of DM in persons requiring insulin.3 It is indicated for patients
with Type 1 DM ≥ 2 years of age. The Omnipod 5 is able to reliably and
securely communicate with compatible, digitally connected devices, including
automated insulin dosing software, to receive, execute, and confirm
commands from these devices.
• Omnipod GO is intended for the SC infusion of insulin at a preset basal rate
in one 24-hour time period for 3 days (72 hours) in adults with Type 2 DM.4
Dosing
For the Omnipod, Omnipod DASH, and Omnipod 5 systems, the pods should be
replaced at least once every 72 hours or after delivering 200 units of U-100 insulin,
whichever comes first.1-3 Pods may also need to be replaced more frequently due
to possible issues with the pod itself or the device. The type of insulin may also
dictate how frequently the pod needs to be changed. Omnipod GO pods delivery
insulin continuously for up to 72 hours at a fixed daily basal rate.4
The Omnipod and Omnipod DASH systems have been studied and found to be safe
with the following U-100 rapid-acting insulins: NovoLog® (insulin aspart), Fiasp®
(insulin aspart), Humalog® (insulin lispro), Lyumjev™ (insulin lispro-aabc), Apidra®
(insulin glulisine), or Admelog® (insulin lispro). Novolog, Fiasp, Humalog, Lyumjev,
and Admelog are compatible with for use up to 72 hours (3 days), while Apidra is
compatible for use up to 48 hours (2 days).1,2
The Omnipod 5 system is compatible with NovoLog, Humalog, and Admelog, which
can all be used for up to 72 hours (3 days).3
The Omnipod GO system is compatible with NovoLog, Fiasp, Humalog, Admelog,
and Lyumjev, which can all be used for up to 72 hours (3 days).4
Availability
The Omnipod, Omnipod DASH, and Omnipod 5 systems each consist of two parts:
the pod, which delivers insulin to the patient, and the Personal Diabetes Manager
(PDM), which allows the patient to control the pod.1,2 The pod itself is a
lightweight, self-adhesive device that the patient fills with insulin and wear directly
on their body. Each pod requires a minimum of 85 units of U-100 insulin to begin
operation and can hold up to 200 units. The pod is applied to the patient’s skin
with an adhesive, similar to an adhesive bandage and delivers insulin into through a
small flexible cannula, based on instructions from the PDM.
Unlike the other Omnipod systems, Omnipod GO does not require the use of a
dedicated controller or mobile application.4 Omnipod GO pods deliver insulin at
preprogrammed basal rates of 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, or 40 units per day over 3
days (72 hours). Pods are available in packages of 5 pods each.
Of note, the pods from the different Omnipod systems are not interchangeable with
one another. For example, Omnipod Pods will not be compatible with an Omnipod
DASH system.
