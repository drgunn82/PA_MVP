EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE

CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Diacomit, an antiseizure medication (ASM), is indicated for the treatment of seizures
associated with Dravet syndrome in patients ≥ 6 months of age and weighing ≥ 7 kg taking
clobazam.1 There are no clinical data to support the use of Diacomit as monotherapy in Dravet
syndrome.
Disease Overview
Dravet syndrome is a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy (dysfunction of the brain) marked
with frequent and/or prolonged seizures.2,3 The seizures generally begin in the first year of
life in an otherwise healthy infant. Affected individuals can develop many seizure types:
myoclonic, tonic-clonic, absence, atypical absence, atonic, focal aware or impaired awareness
(previously called partial seizures), and status epilepticus.3 Two or more ASMs are often
needed to control the seizures; most of the seizures are refractory to medications. The goals
of treatment are cessation of prolonged convulsions, reduction in overall seizure frequency,
and minimization of treatment side effects.4,5
Clinical Efficacy in Other Refractory Seizures
In one study (n = 212), Diacomit was studied in children with different types of epilepsy
syndromes (including Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome [LGS]; infantile spasms; infection‐related or
anoxo-ischemic epilepsy syndromes; tuberous sclerosis complex; Sturge‐Weber syndrome;
Doose syndrome; cortical malformation/dysplasia; and epilepsy with myoclonic absences)

Policy
whose seizures were refractory to more than two ASMs (including vigabatrin).6 In the 88
patients who completed the 3-month placebo-controlled study, 56.8% of patients with partial
epilepsy responded (with 14% becoming seizure-free) compared with 41.9% of patients with
generalized epilepsy and 38.4% of patients with myoclonic epilepsy. Diacomit has also been
administered to patients with refractory epileptic encephalopathies due to etiologies other
than Dravet syndrome.7 A single-blind, exploratory trial evaluated Diacomit in combination
with standard treatment in 16 patients with LGS and 8 patients with symptomatic generalized
epilepsy of the Lennox-Gastaut type.8 There were 15 evaluable patients with LGS. The overall
results identified some benefit for LGS where 60% of patients were responders (based on
50% responder rate). Diacomit treatment produced a mean 62% seizure reduction and a
median 80% reduction from baseline. Additionally, a published study of Diacomit added to
carbamazepine in childhood partial epilepsy (n = 67) demonstrated seizure response in 32
patients with conditions including herpetic encephalitis, LGS, and tuberous sclerosis complex.9
Guidelines/Recommendations
At this time, there are three drugs approved for the treatment of seizures associated with
Dravet syndrome: Diacomit, Epidiolex® (cannabidiol oral solution), and Fintepla®
(fenfluramine oral solution).1,10,11 An expert panel considers valproic acid and clobazam to be
the first-line treatment for Dravet syndrome.5 If seizure control is suboptimal, Diacomit and
topiramate are second-line treatment. Ketogenic diet is moderately effective and can also be
considered second-line. The Dravet Foundation states that Diacomit, Epidiolex, and Fintepla
are considered first-line agents for the treatment of Dravet syndrome.2 If control is still
inadequate, other therapies to consider are clonazepam, levetiracetam, and zonisamide.2,4,5
Sodium channel blockers (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin)
can worsen seizures in Dravet syndrome. Additionally, vigabatrin and tiagabine may increase
the frequency of myoclonic seizures and should be avoided.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Diacomit. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Diacomit as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval requires
Diacomit to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Diacomit® (stiripentol capsules and powder for oral suspension (Biocodex)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for
