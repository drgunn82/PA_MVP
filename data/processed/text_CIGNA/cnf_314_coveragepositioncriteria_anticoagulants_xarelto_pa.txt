INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Xarelto, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Non-valvular atrial fibrillation, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic
embolism in adults.
• Coronary artery disease, in combination with aspirin, to reduce the risk of
major adverse cardiovascular events in adults.
• Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary
embolism (PE), in adults undergoing knee or hip replacement surgery.
• Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical
patients, in adults at risk for thromboembolic complications and not at high
risk of bleeding.
• Peripheral artery disease, including patients after recent lower extremity
revascularization due to symptomatic peripheral artery disease, in combination
with aspirin, to reduce the risk of major thrombotic vascular events in adults.
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Anticoagulants – Xarelto Prior Authorization with Step
Therapy Policy
• Treatment of DVT and/or PE, as well as reduction in the risk of
recurrence of DVT and/or PE in patients at continued risk for recurrent DVT
and/or PE after completion of initial treatment. Xarelto is approved for these
indications in pediatric patients from birth to < 18 years of age as well as
adults.
• Thromboprophylaxis in a patient with congenital heart disease after
the Fontan procedure, in pediatric patients ≥ 2 years of age.
Dosing and Administration
It is noted in the prescribing information for Xarelto that different dosage forms can
be utilized to achieve the necessary dose and route of administration for adult and
pediatric patients.1 Adult patients can be given tablets or oral suspension.
For pediatric patients, tablets must not be split in an attempt to provide a fraction of
a tablet dose.1 For treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and reduction in
risk of VTE recurrence in pediatric patients, it is noted that the oral suspension or
tablets may be used for a patient weighing ≥ 30 kg; for patients weighing < 30 kg,
only the oral suspension should be used. For thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients
with congenital heart disease after the Fontan procedure, the oral suspension or
tablets may be used for a patient weighing ≥ 50 kg; only the oral suspension should
be used for a patient weighing < 50 kg. It is noted that there are no safety, efficacy,
pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data to support the use of Xarelto 2.5 mg
tablets in pediatric patients; therefore, Xarelto 2.5 mg tablets are not recommended
in pediatric patients.
Guidelines
Guidelines are available which support the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)
in their commonly used clinical settings, such as DVT/PE2-5 and atrial fibrillation.6,7
In patients who are eligible for a DOAC, these are generally preferred over vitamin K
antagonists (e.g., warfarin). It is noted that in the randomized trials in atrial
fibrillation, DOACs were consistently at least non-inferior to warfarin regarding the
composite of stroke or systemic embolism and were associated with lower risk of
serious bleeding.7 Guidelines from the Canadian Cardiovascular Society for
peripheral arterial disease (2022) recommend Xarelto in combination with aspirin in
selected patients with peripheral arterial disease (high risk of ischemic events).8
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
Although data are not robust regarding use of DOACs in other off-label
thromboembolic-related conditions, American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST)
guidelines (2021) suggest anticoagulation for certain patients (e.g., superficial vein
thrombosis).2 The choice of anticoagulant is often individualized based on patient-
specific factors; therefore, for certain patients, DOAC use may be considered in
practice. Evidence for DOACs is limited for off-label scenarios; in general, there is
more clinical experience with agents such as vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin)
and low molecular weight heparin in these settings.
