INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Myfembree, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist
with added estrogen and progestin therapy, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine
leiomyomas (fibroids) in premenopausal women.
• Management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis in
premenopausal women.
Limitation of Use. Use should be limited to 24 months due to the risk of continued
bone loss which may not be reversible.1
Disease Overview
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Antagonists –
Myfembree Prior Authorization Policy
Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign tumors. They are the most frequent
gynecologic benign disease.2 Fibroids can be asymptomatic or cause symptoms;
symptoms generally present as abnormal (heavy) uterine bleeding or pelvic
pain/pressure. Heavy menstrual bleeding can cause associated problems, such as
iron deficiency anemia. The actual prevalence of uterine fibroids is difficult to
ascertain since many patients are asymptomatic, but it is estimated that fibroids can
be detected in up to 80% of women by 50 years of age.3
Endometriosis is a condition where the tissues similar to the lining of the uterus (or
endometrium) migrate outside of the womb to other body sites.4,5 The migrated
tissues are generally found in the pelvic cavity (e.g., peritoneum, uterosacral
ligaments, rectal-vaginal septum, or any spaces between the bladder, uterus, vagina,
and rectum) and can attach to any of the female reproductive organs (e.g., ovaries,
fallopian tubes). The migrated tissue is less commonly found outside the pelvic cavity
or on the intestines, colon, appendix or rectum. Endometriosis impacts up to 10%
of patients of reproductive age in the US.5
Guidelines
Abnormal Uterine Bleeding/Uterine Leiomyomata (Fibroids)
Myfembree is addressed in the American College of Obstetrician and Gynecologists
(ACOG) guidelines on the management of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas (2021)
as a medication under clinical study (prior to FDA approval).6 Medical treatment
options for uterine leiomyomas include agents that address only bleeding symptoms,
such as GnRH antagonists, levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices,
contraceptive steroids, and tranexamic acid. Agents that reduce both bleeding and
leiomyoma size include GnRH agonists and selective progesterone receptor
modulators (SPRMs). SPRMs are not approved in the US for the treatment of uterine
leiomyomas. An oral GnRH antagonist, such as Oriahnn or Myfembree, can be
considered for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding related to leiomyomas for
up to 2 years. The hormonal add-back therapy is indicated to offset the
hypoestrogenic effects of the product.
Endometriosis
According to the ACOG practice bulletin on the management of endometriosis (2010,
reaffirmed 2018), empiric therapy with a 3-month course of a GnRH agonist is
appropriate after an appropriate pretreatment evaluation (to exclude other causes of
chronic pelvic pain) and failure of initial treatment with oral contraceptives and
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).7
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Myfembree.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval
is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Myfembree as
well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Antagonists – Myfembree
Prior Authorization Policy
for certain diagnoses requires Myfembree to be prescribed by or in consultation with
a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.

heavy menstrual bleeding; AND
Note: Examples of therapy for the medical management of heavy menstrual
bleeding include combination estrogen-progestin contraceptives (oral tablets,

medroxyprogesterone acetate), depo-medroxyprogesterone injection,
tranexamic acid tablets.
F) Patient has not previously received a continuous regimen of 24 months or
longer of therapy with Myfembree or Oriahnn; AND
