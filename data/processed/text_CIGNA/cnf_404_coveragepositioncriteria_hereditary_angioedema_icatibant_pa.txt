CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Icatibant is a synthetic decapeptide that is indicated for the treatment of acute
hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in adults ≥ 18 years of age.1
Guidelines
According to US HAE Association Medical Advisory Board Guidelines (2020), when
HAE is suspected based on clinical presentation, appropriate testing includes
measurement of the serum C4 level, C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) antigenic level,
and C1-INH functional level.2 Low C4 plus low C1-INH antigenic or functional level is
consistent with a diagnosis of HAE types I/II. The goal of acute therapy is to minimize
morbidity and prevent mortality from an ongoing HAE attack. Patients must have
ready access to effective on-demand medication to administer at the onset of an HAE
attack. All HAE attacks are eligible for treatment, irrespective of the location of
swelling or severity of the attack. First-line treatments include plasma-derived C1-
INH, Ruconest® (C1-INH [recombinant] intravenous [IV] infusion), Kalbitor®
(ecallantide subcutaneous injection), and icatibant.
In guidelines from the World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy and
Clinical Immunology (2021), it is recommended that all attacks be treated with either
IV C1-INH, Kalbitor, or icatibant (evidence level A for all).3 Regarding IV C1-INH, it
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hereditary Angioedema ( Icatibant Prior Authorization
Policy
is noted that Berinert® (C1 esterase inhibitor [human] IV infusion) and Cinryze® (C1
esterase inhibitor [human] IV infusion) are both plasma-derived products available
for this use, although indications vary globally. It is essential that patients have on-
demand medication to treat all attacks; thus, the guidelines recommend that patients
have and carry medication for treatment of at least two attacks.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of icatibant.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with icatibant, approval requires icatibant to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. A patient who has previously
met initial therapy criteria for icatibant for the requested indication under the
Coverage Review Department and is currently receiving the requested therapy is only
required to meet the continuation therapy criteria (i.e., patient who has treated
previous HAE attacks with icatibant). If past criteria have not been met under the
Coverage Review Department and the patient has treated previous HAE attacks with
icatibant, initial therapy criteria must be met.
Documentation: Documentation will be required where noted in the criteria as
[documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not limited to,
chart notes, laboratory records, and prescription claims records.
• Firazyr® (icatibant subcutaneous injection ( Takeda, generic)

is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for fda-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Due to C1 Inhibitor (C1-INH) Deficiency –
Treatment of Acute Attacks. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets one of
the following (A or B):
A) Initial therapy. Approve if the patient meets both of the following (i and ii):
i. Patient has HAE type I or type II as confirmed by the following diagnostic
criteria (a and b):
Note: A diagnosis of HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE type III)
does NOT satisfy this requirement.
a) Patient has low levels of functional C1-INH protein (< 50% of normal)
at baseline, as defined by the laboratory reference values
[documentation required]; AND
b) Patient has lower than normal serum C4 levels at baseline, as defined
by the laboratory reference values [documentation required]; AND

ii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an
allergist/immunologist or a physician who specializes in the treatment of
HAE or related disorders.
B) Patient who has treated previous HAE attacks with icatibant. Approve if the
patient meets all of the following (i, ii, and iii):
Note: If the patient is currently receiving the requested therapy but has not
previously received approval of icatibant for this indication through the
Coverage Review Department, review under criteria for Initial Therapy.
i. Patient has a diagnosis of HAE type I or type II [documentation
required]; AND
Note: A diagnosis of HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE type III)
does NOT satisfy this requirement.
ii. According to the prescriber, the patient has had a favorable clinical
response with icatibant treatment; AND
Note: Examples of a favorable clinical response include decrease in the
duration of HAE attacks, quick onset of symptom relief, complete resolution
of symptoms, or decrease in HAE acute attack frequency or severity.
iii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an
allergist/immunologist or a physician who specializes in the treatment of
HAE or related disorders.
