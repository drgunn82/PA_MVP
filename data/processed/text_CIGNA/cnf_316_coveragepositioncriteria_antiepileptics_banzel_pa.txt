INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Rufinamide is indicated for adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients ≥ 1 year of age.1
Although rufinamide is only FDA-approved for use in LGS, clinical trial data indicate
the drug may also be beneficial as adjunctive treatment of refractory focal epilepsy.2
A review of six clinical trials found that rufinamide, when used as an add-on
treatment, was effective in reducing seizure frequency in patients with drug-resistant
focal epilepsy.
Disease Overview
LGS is a severe epileptic and developmental encephalopathy associated with a high
rate of morbidity and mortality.3,4 LGS most often begins between 3 years and 5
years of age and comprises approximately 3% to 4% of childhood epilepsies.3-6
Affected children experience several different types of seizures, most commonly
Page 1 of 4: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Antiseizure Medications -
Rufinamide Prior Authorization Policy
atonic seizures (sudden loss of muscle tone and limpness, also called drop seizures)
and tonic seizures (increased muscle tone and muscle stiffness).3,6 The three main
forms of treatment of LGS are antiseizure medications (ASMs), dietary therapy
(typically the ketogenic diet), and device/surgery (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation,
corpus callosotomy).6 None of the therapies are effective in all cases of LGS and the
disorder has proven particularly resistant to most therapeutic options. The choice of
treatment should take into consideration the patient’s age and other associated
conditions.
Guidelines/Recommendations
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Currently, the FDA-approved drugs for this condition
are Epidiolex® (cannabidiol oral solution), clobazam, clonazepam, felbamate,
Fintepla® (fenfluramine oral solution), lamotrigine, rufinamide, and topiramate.7
Despite the lack of level I or level II evidence, valproic acid remains a mainstay in
treatment.5,6,8 If valproic acid does not provide adequate seizure control, which is
almost always the case, lamotrigine should be added as the first adjunctive therapy.4
If the combination regimen of valproic acid and lamotrigine does not provide
adequate control, then rufinamide should be initiated and either valproic acid or
lamotrigine should be discontinued. If seizure control is still not achieved, the next
adjunctive therapies to consider are topiramate, clobazam, and felbamate. There is
limited evidence for the use of levetiracetam, zonisamide, and Fycompa®
(perampanel tablets and oral suspension). Where possible, no more than two ASMs
should be used concomitantly; use of multiple ASMs increase the risk of side effects
and/or drug-drug interactions.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of rufinamide.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with rufinamide as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires rufinamide to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
