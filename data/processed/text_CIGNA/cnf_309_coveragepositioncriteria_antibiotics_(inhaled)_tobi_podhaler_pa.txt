REVIEW DATE: 03/12/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
TOBI Podhaler, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, is indicated for the management of
cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.1 Safety and efficacy
have not been demonstrated in patients < 6 years of age, patients with forced
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) < 25% or > 80% predicted, or patients
1
colonized with Burkholderia cepacia.
Guidelines
The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Pulmonary Therapeutics Committee (2013)
provides recommendations for the use of chronic medications in the management of
CF lung disease.2 In patients ≥ 6 years of age with CF and moderate-to-severe lung
disease with P. aeruginosa persistently present in cultures of the airways, chronic use
of inhaled tobramycin is strongly recommended to improve lung function and quality
of life, and reduce exacerbations. For mild disease, the Committee recommends
chronic use of inhaled tobramycin for patients ≥ 6 years of age with CF and P.
aeruginosa persistently present in cultures of the airways, to reduce exacerbations.
The CFF published a systematic review of the literature regarding eradication of initial
P. aeruginosa infections to develop guidelines for effective prevention (2014).3 The
recommendations pertaining to inhaled antibiotics are as follows: 1) Inhaled
Page 1 of 3 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Antibiotics (Inhaled) – TOBI Podhaler Prior Authorization
Policy
antibiotic therapy is recommended for the treatment of initial or new growth of P.
aeruginosa (the favored antibiotic regimen is tobramycin [300 mg twice daily ] for
28 days); and 2) Prophylactic antipseudomonal antibiotics to prevent the acquisition
of P. aeruginosa are not recommended.
The American Thoracic Society (ATS) published a clinical review (2013) of non-cystic
fibrosis bronchiectasis on their webpage.4 The review lists nebulized antibiotics (e.g.,
colistin, gentamicin, tobramycin) as treatment options for the eradication or
suppression of P. aeruginosa. The European Respiratory Society (ERS) have
published guidelines (2017) for the management of adult bronchiectasis and
recommends patients with a new isolate of P. aeruginosa be offered eradication
antibiotic treatment which includes nebulized antibiotics (e.g., colistin, gentamicin,
tobramycin).5 Neither the ATS nor the ERS guidelines include TOBI Podhaler as a
treatment option for bronchiectasis and no clinical trials have been published with
TOBI Podhaler for treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of TOBI
Podhaler. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where
the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with TOBI
Podhaler as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, approval requires TOBI Podhaler to be prescribed by or in consultation with
a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
