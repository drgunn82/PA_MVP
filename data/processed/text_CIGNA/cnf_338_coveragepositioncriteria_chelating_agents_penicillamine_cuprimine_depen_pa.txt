INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Penicillamine products (capsules [Cuprimine, generic] and tablets [Depen, generic])
are chelating agents indicated for the following uses:1,2
• Cystinuria.
• Rheumatoid arthritis, severe, active disease in patients who have failed to
respond to an adequate trial of conventional therapy.
• Wilson’s disease (hepatolenticular degeneration).
Product labeling for Cuprimine and Depen is identical, apart from the differences in
dosage forms: Cuprimine is supplied as 250 mg capsules; Depen is supplied as 250
mg tablets.1,2
Guidelines
Penicillamine is discussed in the following guidelines:
• Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from American College of Rheumatology
(2021) do not provide recommendations specifically for the use of
penicillamine for rheumatoid arthritis.5
• Wilson’s Disease:
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Chelating Agents – Penicillamine Products Prior
Authorization with Step Therapy Policy
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) provides
guidelines for the diagnosis and management of Wilson’s disease (2022).3
Diagnosis of Wilson’s disease is confirmed by conducting genetic testing
confirming biallelic pathogenic ATP7B mutations or confirmation of at least
two clinical features associated with Wilson’s disease (Kayser-Fleischer rings,
serum ceruloplasmin levels < 20 mg/dL, liver biopsy, 24-hour urinary copper
> 40 mcg/24 hours). The AASLD recommends a chelating agent
(penicillamine or trientine) for initial treatment in symptomatic patients. For
the treatment of presymptomatic patients or those on maintenance therapy,
chelating agents and zinc are both treatment options.
The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) also published a
clinical practice guideline for the treatment of Wilson’s disease (2012).4 Like
the AASLD, the EASL acknowledges that numerous studies have
demonstrated the effectiveness of penicillamine. A chelating agent
(penicillamine or trientine) is the recommended initial treatment of
symptomatic patients and a chelating agent or zinc may be used for the
treatment of presymptomatic patients or patients established on
maintenance therapy. In patients with neurological disease established on
maintenance therapy, either a chelating agent or zinc may be used; zinc may
have a role as first-line therapy in these patients. If zinc is used, careful
monitoring of transaminases is needed, with changing to chelators if these
laboratory parameters are increasing.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of the
penicillamine products. This Prior Authorization Policy also contains a Step Therapy
component. When clinically appropriate, the patient is directed to try generic
penicillamine (Step 1) prior to brand Cuprimine or Depen (Step 2). If the patient is
requesting brand Cuprimine or brand Depen and meets the standard Chelating
Agents – Penicillamine Prior Authorization criteria, but has not met the Step
Therapy requirement (i.e. has not tried generic penicillamine), an approval for
generic penicillamine will be authorized. All approvals are provided for the duration
noted below. Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis
of patients treated with penicillamine products for Wilson’s disease as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval for this
condition requires penicillamine products to be prescribed by or in consultation with
a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
I. Penicillamine capsules (Cuprimine, generic)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):

FDA-Approved Indications

B) Patient meets ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Generic penicillamine capsules are requested; OR
ii. If brand Cuprimine is being requested, patient has tried generic
penicillamine capsules AND cannot take generic penicillamine capsules
due to a formulation difference in the inactive ingredient(s) [e.g.,
difference in dyes, fillers, preservatives] between the Brand and the
bioequivalent generic product which, per the prescriber, would result in a
significant allergy or serious adverse reaction.
2. Wilson’s Disease. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of the following
(A, B, C, and D):
A) Diagnosis of Wilson’s disease is confirmed by ONE of the following (i or ii):

either symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals); OR
ii. Confirmation of at least TWO of the following (TWO of a, b, c, or d):
a) Presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings; OR

zinc would not be an appropriate therapy; OR
