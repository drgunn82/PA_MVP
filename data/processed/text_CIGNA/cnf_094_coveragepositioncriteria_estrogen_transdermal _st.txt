DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
All of the transdermal estrogen products are indicated for the treatment of moderate
to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause.1-7,12 The
estradiol gel, EstroGel, and the estradiol patches, Climara and Vivelle-Dot (and
generic), are also indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of
vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause.1,5,7 Climara, Minivelle,
and Vivelle-Dot (and generic) are all additionally indicated for the prevention of
postmenopausal osteoporosis.5-7 Climara and Vivelle-Dot (and generic) have an
additional indication for the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to
hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure.5,7
Guidelines
Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms associated
with menopause and genitourinary symptoms of menopause.8 Systemic estrogen
therapy can be used when vasomotor symptoms are present.9 Hormone therapy
Page 1 of 3 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Estrogen – Transdermal Step Therapy Policy
should be individualized, taking into account the indication(s) or evidence-based
treatment goals and considering the woman’s age and/or time since menopause in
relation to initiation or continuation, the woman’s personal health risks and
preferences, and the balance of potential benefits and risk of hormonal versus non-
hormonal therapies. Multiple guidelines, including from the American Academy of
Clinical Endocrinologists (2017) and the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists (reaffirmed 2019), note that transdermal use of estrogen as compared
with oral estrogen products may be less likely to produce thrombotic risk; although
neither guidelines recommend a specific transdermal agent.10,11
