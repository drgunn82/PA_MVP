INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Zymfentra, a subcutaneous (SC) tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor, is indicated
for the following uses:1
• Crohn’s disease, as maintenance treatment for moderately to severely
active disease in adults who have received three induction doses with an
infliximab intravenous product.
• Ulcerative colitis, as maintenance treatment for moderately to severely
active disease in adults who have received three induction doses with an
infliximab intravenous product.
Dosing
Therapy begins with an infliximab intravenous (IV) product administered as an
induction regimen at Weeks 0, 2, and 6.1 At Week 10 or at any scheduled
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Zymfentra Drug Quantity
Management Policy – Per Days
infliximab IV infusion in patients with a clinical response or remission, therapy can
be switched to Zymfentra. The recommended dose of Zymfentra is 120 mg
administered subcutaneously once every 2 weeks (Q2W).
Dose Escalation in Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis
There are data to support dose escalation of Zymfentra from 120 mg Q2W to 240
mg Q2W in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.2 In LIBERTY-OLE (n = 626
[278 with CD; 348 with UC]), an open-label extension study that enrolled patients
from the LIBERTY-CD and LIBERTY-UC pivotal studies, patients with a clinical
response to infliximab 5 mg/kg IV were randomized to Zymfentra 120 mg SC Q2W
or placebo. From Week 22, patients in either group that demonstrated a loss of
response to treatment were dose adjusted to Zymfentra 240 mg Q2W and enrolled
in the OLE. Additionally, any patient that experienced loss of response during the
OLE (Week 56 to Week 102) could also be dose adjusted to Zymfentra 240 mg
Q2W.
• Crohn’s disease results: In patients who had their dose adjusted on or after
Week 22, a significant difference in the Crohn’s disease activity index (CDAI)
score from the dose adjusted visit to Week 102 was observed in those
transitioned from standard dosing and placebo. Of the 278 patients, 86
(31%) had their dose increased to Zymfentra 240 mg Q2W (42 were
increased from 120 mg Q2W and 44 were transitioned from placebo). At
Week 102, clinical remission was achieved in 72% of patients that
transitioned from Zymfentra 120 mg to Zymfentra 240 mg Q2W and 77% for
those transitioned from placebo to Zymfentra 240 mg Q2W.
• Ulcerative colitis results: In patients who had their dose adjusted on or after
Week 22, a significant difference in the modified Mayo score (MMS) and
partial Mayo score from the dose adjusted visit to Week 102 was observed in
those transitioned from standard dosing and placebo. Of the 348 patients,
131 (38%) had their dose increased to Zymfentra 240 mg Q2W (71 were
increased from 120 mg Q2W and 60 were increased from placebo). At Week
102, clinical remission was achieved in 35% of patients that transitioned
from Zymfentra 120 mg to Zymfentra 240 mg Q2W and 55% for those
transitioned from placebo to Zymfentra 240 mg Q2W.
Availability
Zymfentra is available as a 120 mg/mL prefilled pens and syringes.1 Infliximab is
also available as an IV product is not targeted in this policy.
