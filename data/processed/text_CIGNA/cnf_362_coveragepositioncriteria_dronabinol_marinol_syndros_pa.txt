CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Dronabinol capsules and Syndros are cannabinoids indicated for the following
uses:1,2
• Anorexia associated with weight loss, in patients with Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
• Nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, in
patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic
treatments.
Guidelines
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines regarding the
treatment of emesis (version 2.2024 – September 27, 2024) include various
antiemetic regimens depending upon the emetogenic potential of the chemotherapy
agent(s) being administered.3 For breakthrough emesis, the guidelines recommend
adding an agent from a different drug class to the current regimen, but no
preference is given among specific products. Dronabinol is included in the list of
medications for the treatment of refractory nausea or emesis. Other recommended
agents for breakthrough nausea or emesis include serotonin receptor antagonists,
olanzapine, lorazepam, haloperidol, metoclopramide, scopolamine,

prochlorperazine, promethazine, and dexamethasone. The guidelines also note that
dronabinol capsules are not bioequivalent to the oral solution.
