CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Camzyos, a cardiac myosin inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic
New York Heart Association Class (NYHA) II to III obstructive hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy in adults to improve functional capacity and symptoms.
Disease Overview
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a complex myocardial disorder in which the walls of
the heart muscle, more specifically the left ventricle, are thickened or
hypertrophied.2-5 The condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The
estimated prevalence is one in 200 to 500 adults. Patients of any age can be
impacted. However, many patients may be undiagnosed or asymptomatic.
Diagnoses is usually by echocardiographic or magnetic resonance imaging which
reveals a hypertrophied, nondilated left ventricle without another identifiable
cardiac, systemic, metabolic or syndromic disease. The left ventricle becomes stiff,
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Cardiology – Camzyos Prior Authorization Policy
which makes it more difficult for the heart to normally expand and fill with blood.
The amount of blood that the left ventricle can hold and pump throughout the body
is reduced; the hypertrophied heart muscle may also pump with too much force.
Many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have obstructive disease in which
the path for blood flow out of the heart can narrow and the output to the rest of the
body may be restricted which is referred to as left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction. This forces the heart to pump harder to overcome the obstructive
forces. Symptoms that are commonly present with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
include shortness of breath, palpitations, light headedness, chest pain, fatigue, and
exercise intolerance. Many patients have heart failure, as well as atrial fibrillation
or other ventricular arrhythmias. Sudden death may also result. Hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy is due to enhanced interactions between two cardiac proteins, actin
and myosin. Camzyos works by reducing the number of intersections formed
between actin and myosin which leads to more optimized heart relaxation and
filling; lessened heart muscle workload during contractions; and improved efficiency
in energy utilized for each heartbeat. Before approval of Camzyos, treatment for
obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy focused on symptomatic relief with
medications such as beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
(CCBs), and disopyramide. Septal reduction therapy is an option.
Clinical Efficacy
EXPLORER-HCM was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
trial that evaluated Camzyos in over 250 patients with symptomatic NYHA Class II
or III obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.1,2 Patients had a left ventricular
ejection fraction ≥ 55% and a left ventricular outflow tract peak gradient ≥ 50
mmHg (at rest or with provocation [Valsalva maneuver or post exercise]).
Unexplained left ventricular hypertrophy was present with maximal left ventricular
wall thickness of ≥ 15 mm or ≥ 13 mm if the patient had familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.2 Approximately 75% of patients were receiving beta blockers and
17% of patients were on CCBs for symptoms. The primary composite functional
endpoint, evaluated at 30 weeks, was defined as the proportion of patients who
achieved either improvement of mixed venous oxygen tension/peak oxygen
consumption (pVO ) by ≥ 1.5 mL/kg/min plus improvement in NYHA class by at
2
least one or improvement of pVO by ≥ 3.0 mL/kg/min plus no worsening in NYHA
2
class. A greater proportion of patients receiving Camzyos met this composite
endpoint compared with patients given placebo (37% vs. 17%, respectively; P =
0.0005). Regarding secondary endpoints, Camzyos led to greater improvements
compared with placebo in measures assessing left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT)
obstruction, functional capacity, and health status. These parameters were
assessed by change from baseline through Week 30 in post-exercise LVOT peak
gradient, change in pVO , proportion of patients with improvement in NYHA class,

terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I levels
from baseline.2 Other data are also available.6
Guidelines
Page 2 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Cardiology – Camzyos Prior Authorization Policy
Guidelines have not incorporated Camzyos.
• Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy: In 2020, the American Heart Association
and the American College of Cardiology published guidelines for the diagnosis
and treatment of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.7 For
symptomatic patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
attributable to LVOT obstruction, nonvasodilating beta blockers are
recommended to be titrated to effectiveness or maximally tolerated doses. In
patients for whom beta blockers are not effective or not tolerated,
substitution with nondihydropyridine CCBs (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem) is
recommended. If the patient continues to have persistent severe symptoms
despite beta blocker therapy or CCBs, adding disopyramide in combination
with one of the other drugs is recommended. Also, septal reduction therapy,
performed at experienced centers, is an option for selected patients. One of
the other key steps in managing symptomatic, obstructive hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy is to eliminate medication that may promote outflow tract
obstruction like pure vasodilators (e.g., dihydropyridine CCBs, angiotensin
converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers) and high-dose
diuretics. Low-dose diuretics, when added to other first-line medications,
may be useful for patients with persistent dyspnea or congestive symptoms.
Safety
Camzyos has a Boxed Warning regarding the risk of heart failure.1 The agent may
cause heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. Echocardiogram assessment of left
ventricular ejection fraction is required before and during Camzyos use. Initiation in
patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 55% is not recommended.
Therapy should be interrupted if left ventricular ejection fraction is less than 50% or
if worsening clinical status occurs. Certain cytochrome P450 inhibitors and inducers
are contraindicated in patients receiving Camzyos due to an increased risk of heart
failure. Camzyos is available only through a restricted program called the Camzyos
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program. Notable requirements
include the following:
• Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the Camzyos REMS program.
• Patients must enroll in the Camzyos REMS program and comply with ongoing
monitoring requirements.
• Pharmacies must be certified by enrolling in the Camzyos REMS program and
must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive Camzyos.
• Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute the medication to certified
pharmacies.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Camzyos. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Camzyos as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Camzyos to be prescribed by a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
