INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Rivfloza, a lactate dehydrogenase A-directing (LDHA) small interfering RNA, is
indicated for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) to lower urinary
and plasma oxalate levels in adults and children ≥ 9 years of age with relatively
preserved kidney function.1
Disease Overview
Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 is a rare autosomal recessive inborn error of glyoxylate
metabolism that results in the overproduction of oxalate, which forms insoluble
calcium oxalate crystals that accumulate in the kidney and other organs, leading to
issues such as nephrocalcinosis, formation of renal stones, and renal impairment.2
Mutations in the alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase gene (AGXT) cause primary
hyperoxaluria type 1.3 Liver transplantation is the only curative intervention for
primary hyperoxaluria type 1 as it corrects the underlying enzymatic defect due to
mutations of the AGXT gene.2-4
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Rivfloza for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1 has been
evaluated in one pivotal study.1,5 The study included patients ≥ 9 years of age with
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Metabolic Disorders – Primary Hyperoxaluria
Medications – Rivfloza Prior Authorization Policy
genetically confirmed PH1 and urinary oxalate excretion ≥ 0.7 mmol/24 hr/1.73 m2.
An ongoing open-label extension trial is following patients for up to 4 years.6 The
primary efficacy endpoint of the area under the curve (AUC) percent change from
baseline in 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion was assessed following 6 months of
Rivfloza therapy.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Rivfloza. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Rivfloza as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Rivfloza to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated. All reviews will be forwarded to the Medical
Director for evaluation.
Documentation: Documentation is required for use of Rivfloza as noted in the
criteria as [documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not
limited to, chart notes, laboratory tests, claims records, and/or other information.
Subsequent coverage reviews for a patient who has previously met the
documentation requirements and related criteria in the Rivfloza Prior Authorization
Policy through the Coverage Review Department, and who is requesting
reauthorization, are NOT required to re-submit documentation for reauthorization,
except for the criterion requiring documentation of a continued benefit from Rivfloza
therapy.
• Rivfloza™ (nedosiran subcutaneous injection – Novo Nordisk)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1. Approve Rivfloza for the duration noted if the
patient meets one of the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets the following (i, ii,
iii, iv, v, and vi):
i. Patient is ≥ 9 years of age; AND
ii. Patient has had a genetic test confirming the diagnosis of Primary
Hyperoxaluria Type 1 via identification of an alanine:glyoxylate
aminotransferase gene (AGXT) mutation [documentation required];
AND
iii. Patient has an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 [documentation required]; AND
iv. Patient meets ONE of the following (a, b, or c):
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Metabolic Disorders – Primary Hyperoxaluria Medications –
Rivfloza Prior Authorization Policy
a) Patient has a urinary oxalate excretion ≥ 0.7 mmol/24 hours/1.73
meters2 [documentation required]; OR
b) Patient has a urinary oxalate:creatinine ratio above the age-specific
upper limit of normal [documentation required]; OR
c) Patient has a plasma oxalate level ≥ 20 µmol/L [documentation
required]; AND
v. Patient has not previously received a liver transplant for Primary
Hyperoxaluria Type 1; AND
vi. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a nephrologist or
urologist.
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Rivfloza. Approve for 1 year if, according to the
prescriber, the patient is continuing to derive benefit from Rivfloza as
determined by the most recent (i.e., within the past 6 months) objective
measurement [documentation required].
Note: Examples of objective measurements of a response to Rivfloza therapy
are reduced urinary oxalate excretion, decreased urinary oxalate:creatinine
ratio, or reduced plasma oxalate levels from baseline (i.e., prior to Rivfloza
therapy) or improved or stabilized clinical signs/symptoms of Primary
Hyperoxaluria Type 1 (e.g., nephrocalcinosis, formation of renal stones, renal
impairment).
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Rivfloza™ (nedosiran subcutaneous injection – Novo Nordisk)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 2 (PH2). Rivfloza may have benefit in PH2;
however, the efficacy and safety of Rivfloza in patients with PH2 have not been
established. Clinical trials are ongoing.
2. Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 3 (PH3). Rivfloza may have benefit in PH3;
however, the efficacy and safety of Rivfloza in patients with PH3 have not been
established. Clinical trials are ongoing.
3. Primary Hyperoxaluria with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Rivfloza
may have benefit in patients with PH1 or PH2 and ESRD; however, the efficacy
and safety of Rivfloza in this patient population have not been established.
Clinical trials are ongoing.
4. Concurrent use of Rivfloza with Oxlumo (lumasiran subcutaneous
injection). Oxlumo is another small interfering RNA agent and should not be
used with Rivfloza.
