INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA COMPANIES
AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE CLIENTS. COVERAGE
POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES.
PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE,
CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE
STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY
CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S
BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL
OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT.
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN
DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS
INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE
REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING
INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS.
COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN
MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Carbaglu, a carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS 1) activator, is indicated as adjunct
therapy to standard of care for the following uses:1
• N-acteylglutamate synthase (NAGS) deficiency with acute or chronic
hyperammonemia.
• Propionic acidemia or methylmalonic acidemia with acute hyperammonemia.
For NAGS deficiency, the prescribing information notes that treatment with Carbaglu should
be initiated as soon as the disorder is suspected, which may be as soon as birth.1
For acute hyperammonemia due to propionic acidemia or methylmalonic acidemia, Carbaglu
is indicated as adjunctive therapy for acute treatment.1 In this setting, Carbaglu should be
continued until the patient’s ammonia level is < 50 micromol/L and for a maximum duration
of 7 days.
Disease Overview
NAGS Deficiency
Carbaglu is a synthetic analog of N-acetylglutamate, which activates CPS 1, the first
reaction in the urea cycle.1 The function of the urea cycle is to convert ammonia into urea
for urinary excretion. In the case of NAGS deficiency, N-acetylglutamate is not sufficiently
produced due to lack of the NAGS enzyme.2 NAGS deficiency is the rarest urea cycle
disorder with an estimated incidence of less than 1:2,000,000 live births. Age of diagnosis
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Metabolic Disorders – Carbaglu Prior Authorization Policy
can vary from neonatal to adulthood; based on literature review, most cases present in the
early neonatal period. Therefore, newborn screening is of limited value as patients are likely
to be symptomatic before screening results are available. Common presenting features
include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, decreased consciousness, seizures, and hypotonia.
Laboratory abnormalities include hyperammonemia which can lead to significant morbidity
and mortality in severe cases. Genetic testing is required to confirm the diagnosis; however,
given the delays involved with genetic testing, it has been suggested that a therapeutic trial
of Carbaglu should be initiated for any patient with unexplained hyperammonemia.
Propionic Acidemia and Methylmalonic Acidemia
In propionic and methylmalonic acidemias, other enzymatic defects result in accumulation of
propionyl-coenzyme A (CoA), which acts as a competitive inhibitor for NAGS.3,4 The
incidence of propionic acidemia is 1:100,000 to 1:150,000, and the incidence of
methylmalonic acidemia is 1:50,000.3 According to guidelines for management of propionic
acidemia and methylmalonic acidemia (2021), these disorders should be considered in any
newborn/child (critically ill or not) with unexplained metabolic acidosis (with elevated anion
gap); elevated lactate; hyperammonemia; leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia; and/or
urine ketone bodies. If ammonia is increased, further metabolic investigations should be
performed immediately but specific treatment must not be delayed. Carbaglu is supported
as part of the initial management plan for symptomatic hyperammonemia both in patients
with known propionic/methylmalonic acidemia and in undiagnosed patients. Other elements
of initial management include cessation of protein intake, use of intravenous glucose and
insulin, and other medications such as carnitine and vitamin B . Extracorporeal
12
detoxification (i.e., dialysis) may be used in some cases, particularly for extremely elevated
ammonia levels.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Carbaglu. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Carbaglu as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires Carbaglu
to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
• Carbaglu® (carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension – Recordati Rare
Diseases)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for
FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. N-Acetylglutamate Synthase Deficiency with Hyperammonemia. Approve for the
duration noted below if the patient meets ALL of the following (A, B, and C):
A) According to the prescriber, diagnosis is supported by ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Approve for 1 year if genetic testing confirmed a mutation leading to N-
acetylglutamate synthase deficiency; OR
ii. Approve for 3 months if the patient has hyperammonemia diagnosed with an
ammonia level above the upper limit of the normal reference range for the
reporting laboratory; AND
Note: Ammonia level reference ranges are dependent upon patient’s age.

C) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a metabolic disease specialist
(or specialist who focuses on the treatment of metabolic diseases).
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Carbaglu® (carglumic acid tablets for oral suspension – Recordati Rare
Diseases)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for ANY other use(s)
including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated
