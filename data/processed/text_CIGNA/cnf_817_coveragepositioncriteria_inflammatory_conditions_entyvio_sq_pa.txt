INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Entyvio subcutaneous (SC), an integrin receptor antagonist, is indicated for
treatment of the following uses:1
• Crohn’s disease, in adults with moderately to severely active disease.
• Ulcerative colitis, in adults with moderately to severely active disease.
Therapy begins with Entyvio 300 mg IV at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, followed by every 8
weeks thereafter.1 Alternatively, at Week 6, or at any scheduled Entyvio IV infusion
in patients with a clinical response or remission, therapy can be switched to Entyvio
SC. The recommended maintenance dose of Entyvio SC is 108 mg SC once every 2
weeks.
Guidelines
Guidelines for the treatment of inflammatory conditions recommend use of Entyvio.
Page 1 of 7 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Entyvio Subcutaneous Prior
Authorization Policy
• Crohn’s Disease: The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) [2025]
has guidelines for the management of CD in adults.2 In moderate to severe
disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be utilized for
induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended include tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, Entyvio, interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors, IL-
12/23 inhibitors, and Rinvoq® (upadacitinib). If steroids are utilized for
induction, efforts should be made to introduce steroid-sparing agents for
maintenance therapy. Guidelines from the American Gastroenterological
Association (AGA) [2021] include various biologics among the therapies for
moderate to severe CD, for induction and maintenance of remission.3
• Ulcerative Colitis: The AGA (2024) and the ACG (2025) have clinical practice
guidelines on the management of moderate to severe UC.4,5 In moderate to
severe disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be utilized
for induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended include TNF
inhibitors, Entyvio, IL-23 inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, sphingosine-1-
phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. If
steroids are utilized for induction, efforts should be made to introduce steroid-
sparing agents for maintenance therapy. Of note, guidelines state
corticosteroids may be avoided entirely when other effective induction
strategies are planned.5 Both guidelines also recommend that any drug that
effectively treats induction should be continued for maintenance.4,5
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Entyvio
subcutaneous. All approvals are provided for the duration listed below. Because of
the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Entyvio subcutaneous as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-
term efficacy, initial approval requires Entyvio subcutaneous to be prescribed by or
in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Entyvio® (vedolizumab subcutaneous injection – Takeda)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Crohn’s Disease. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of the
following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets ALL of the following
(i, ii, iii, and iv):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. According to the prescriber, the patient is currently receiving Entyvio
intravenous or will receive induction dosing with Entyvio intravenous within
2 months of initiating therapy with Entyvio subcutaneous; AND
iii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a, b, c, or d):

Note: Examples of conventional systemic therapy for Crohn’s disease
include azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate. An exception
to the requirement for a trial of or contraindication to steroids or a trial
of one other conventional systemic agent can be made if the patient has
already tried at least one biologic other than the requested drug. A
biosimilar of the requested biologic does not count. Refer to Appendix
for examples of biologics used for Crohn’s disease. These patients who
have already received a biologic are not required to “step back” and try
another agent. A trial of mesalamine does not count as a systemic
therapy for Crohn’s disease.
c) Patient has enterocutaneous (perianal or abdominal) or rectovaginal
fistulas; OR

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Entyvio® (vedolizumab subcutaneous injection – Takeda)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination
with this medication.
