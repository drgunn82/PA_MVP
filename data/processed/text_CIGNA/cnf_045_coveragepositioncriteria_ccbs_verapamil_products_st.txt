INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
All of the available verapamil formulations are indicated for the treatment of
hypertension.1,2 Verapamil immediate-release is also indicated for the treatment
of angina and specific cardiac arrhythmias.1 Verapamil has also been used for off-
label conditions, such as adjunctive treatment of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and
prophylaxis of migraine and cluster headaches.
Verelan PM is an extended-release controlled onset (COER) formulations designed
to release verapamil 4 to 5 hours after ingestion and should be administered once
daily at bedtime.2 COER formulations result in a maximum plasma concentration of

Therapy Policy
verapamil in the morning hours, approximately 11 hours after ingestion. It has
been hypothesized that the COER verapamil formulations may be more safe and
effective in patients with hypertension than other verapamil formulations because
their concentrations during a 24-hour period are synchronized with biological
rhythm (chronotherapy).4-6 In theory, these formulations may have an advantage
over other sustained-/extended-release verapamil formulations as they would
attenuate the increase in blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac ischemia, and
catecholamines that naturally occur upon awakening and they would not cause
hypotension during sleep. However, the role of verapamil as it relates to
chronotherapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and
mortality (e.g., myocardial infarction [MI], stroke) has not been demonstrated in
controlled, comparative clinical trials.6,7 The Controlled ONset Verapamil
InvestigatioN of Cardiovascular Endpoints (CONVINCE) trial, which was terminated
two years early for commercial reasons, was conducted in part to determine if there
is a difference in the incidence of fatal or nonfatal MI, fatal or nonfatal stroke, or
CV-related death between extended-release controlled onset verapamil ±
hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), HCTZ alone, atenolol alone, or HCTZ in combination
with atenolol.8 The trial results did not provide evidence to support the concept of
chronotherapeutics. Also, one small study comparing the effects of COER verapamil
on the diurnal pattern of forearm vascular resistance in hypertensive and
normotensive patients noted that COER verapamil minimized the diurnal pattern in
forearm vascular resistance, but it did not hinder the early morning rate of blood
pressure rise, despite being at peak concentration.9
POLICY STATEMENT
This program has been developed to encourage the use of a Step 1 Product prior to
the use of a Step 2 Product. If the Step Therapy rule is not met for a Step 2
Product at the point of service, coverage will be determined by the Step Therapy
criteria below. All approvals are provided for 1 year in duration.
Step 1: generic verapamil extended-release capsules, generic verapamil
extended-release tablets, generic verapamil immediate-release tablets,
generic verapamil sustained-release capsules
Step 2: Verelan PM (brand and generic)
Calcium Channel Blockers – Verapamil Products Step Therapy Policy
product(s) is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following step
therapy criteria is(are) met. Any other exception is considered not
medically necessary.
CRITERIA
1. If the patient has tried one Step 1 Product, approve a Step 2 Product.
