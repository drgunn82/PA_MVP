INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL

DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Adalimumab products are tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) approved for the
following:1
• Ankylosing spondylitis, for reducing signs and symptoms in adults with
active disease.
• Crohn’s disease, for treatment of moderately to severely active disease in
patients ≥ 6 years of age.
• Hidradenitis suppurativa, for treatment of moderate to severe disease in
patients ≥ 12 years of age.
• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ± methotrexate for reducing signs and
symptoms of moderately to severely active polyarticular disease in patients ≥
2 years of age.
• Plaque psoriasis, for treatment of adults with moderate to severe chronic
disease who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy and when
other systemic therapies are medically less appropriate.
• Psoriatic arthritis, ± non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
(DMARDs), for reducing the signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression
of structural damage, and improving physical function in adults with active
disease.
• Rheumatoid arthritis, ± methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDS to
reduce the signs and symptoms, induce major clinical response, inhibit the
progression of structural damage, and improve physical function in adults
with moderately to severely active disease.
• Ulcerative colitis, for treatment of moderately to severely active disease in
patients ≥ 5 years of age. However, efficacy has not been established in
patients with ulcerative colitis who have lost response or were intolerant to
another TNFi.
• Uveitis, in patients ≥ 2 years of age with noninfectious intermediate,
posterior, and panuveitis.
Of note, FDA-approved indications for the adalimumab biosimilars to Humira may
differ from the indications listed above.2-10

SC – Subcutaneous; NA – Not applicable; CD – Crohn’s disease; UC – Ulcerative colitis; HS – Hidradenitis
suppurativa; QW – Once weekly; MTX – Methotrexate.
Adalimumab has also demonstrated efficacy for treatment of several off-label
indications such as Behcet’s disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, sarcoidosis, scleritis
or sterile corneal ulceration, and spondyloarthritis (subtypes other than ankylosing
spondylitis).2 A loading dose may be required for these indications and a
maintenance dose of 40 mg administered once every other week is generally
effective for most patients.

POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to promote the safe,
effective, and economic use of adalimumab products and to manage potential
premature dose escalation. If the Drug Quantity Management rule is not met for
the requested medication at the point of service, coverage will be determined by
the Criteria below. Approvals are provided for 1 year in duration, unless otherwise
noted below. “One-time” approvals are provided for 30 days in duration, unless
otherwise noted below. Of note, all adalimumab products of the same strength
(i.e., pens, prefilled syringes, vials) accumulate toward the total quantity limit.

C) Patient weighs between 20 kg (44 lbs) and < 40 kg (88 lbs).
Adalimumab 40 mg pens and prefilled syringes (NOT starter packages)
1. If the patient has been receiving adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 12
weeks or longer and the dose of adalimumab is now being increased to 40 mg
