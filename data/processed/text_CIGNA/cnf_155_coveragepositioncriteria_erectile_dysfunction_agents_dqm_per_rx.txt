CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Stendra, tadalafil (Cialis, generic), vardenafil tablets (generic only), vardenafil
orally disintegrating tablets (generic only), and sildenafil (Viagra, generic) are oral
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE ) inhibitors, which are all indicated for the
5
treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED).1-5 Tadalafil is also indicated for the
treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and
BPH/ED.3 If tadalafil is used with finasteride to initiate BPH treatment, it is
recommended to limit therapy at 26 weeks. This is because the incremental benefit
of tadalafil decreases from 4 weeks to 26 weeks and the benefit beyond 26 weeks
is unknown. Caverject and Caverject Impulse dual chamber system (alprostadil
injection), Edex (alprostadil injection), and Muse (alprostadil urethral suppository)
are other ED agents that are also subject to Per Rx quantity limitations. However,
there are no overrides to these quantity limits and therefore, they are not included
in this policy.

Off-label Dosing
Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia
The 2.5 mg and 5 mg strengths of tadalafil are FDA-approved for daily use in
treating BPH.3 Several studies have also demonstrated the effects of daily tadalafil
10 mg or 20 mg on lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to BPH.6 Additionally,
vardenafil 10 mg twice daily (BID) has been studied for the treatment of LUTS due
to BPH.7 Daily sildenafil (25 mg to 100 mg) has been effective in men with
symptoms of LUTS due to BPH as well.8,9,31-34
Prevention and Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction following Radical
Prostatectomy
PDE inhibitors, primarily sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil, are used for the
5
management of erectile dysfunction following radical prostatectomy.10,11 Daily and
on demand use have been studied and both have been found effective. For
tadalafil, the most common dose is 5 mg once daily (QD). However, the 10 mg and
20 mg strengths have also been studied administered three days per week.12-16
Daily dosing with vardenafil or sildenafil has been found to be beneficial as well.11,17-

Raynaud’s Phenomenon
Sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil have also been used for the management of
Raynaud’s Phenomenon in patients who are unable to use calcium channel
blockers.20-22,30 A dose of up to 20 mg of tadalafil administered QD has been
used.30 Vardenafil at a dose of 10 mg BID has been shown to reduce the number of
attacks per day in patients with Raynaud’s Phenomenon. With sildenafil, a dose of
20 mg QD or BID is generally used initially, and then based on response and
tolerability, may be increased to 20 mg three times daily (TID) as needed. If lower
doses are not effective, the dose may be increased to 40 mg TID, if tolerated.
Additionally, doses of 50 mg BID or TID have been reported as well.
High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema
For prevention of high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), the preferred
pharmacologic option is nifedipine.23 However, PDE inhibitors, sildenafil or
5
tadalafil, may also be used for prevention of HAPE in patients who are not
candidates for nifedipine or for treatment of HAPE when descent is impossible or
delayed. The recommended prevention or treatment dose of tadalafil is 10 mg once
every 12 hours for prevention of HAPE. For sildenafil, the recommended dose is 50
mg once every 8 hours.
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
Adcirca® (tadalafil tablets, generic) contains the same active ingredient as Cialis
(generic).24 Adcirca (generic) is available as 20 mg tablets and is FDA-approved at
a dose of 40 mg QD for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
[WHO Group 1] to improve exercise ability. However, other doses of tadalafil,
including 10 mg QD, have been studied.25,26 Patients requiring doses of 20 mg or
40 mg of tadalafil for PAH should use Adcirca (generic).
Revatio® (sildenafil tablets and oral suspension, generic) contains the same active
ingredient as Viagra (generic).27 Revatio is FDA-approved for the treatment of PAH
(WHO Group 1) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening. It
is also FDA-approved in patients 1 to 17 years of age for the treatment of PAH
(WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability and, in pediatric patients too young to
perform standardized exercise testing, pulmonary hemodynamics thought to
underly improvements in exercise. Revatio (generic) is available as 20 mg tablets
and a 10 mg/mL oral suspension. Viagra (generic) has been used for this
diagnosis.28,29 Doses of Viagra (generic) that were used in these reports ranged
from 25 mg BID to 100 mg five times daily. Patients will have usually been started
on Revatio 20 mg TID.
