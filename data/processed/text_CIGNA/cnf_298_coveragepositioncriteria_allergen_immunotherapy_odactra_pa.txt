DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Odactra, a house dust mite allergen extract, is indicated as immunotherapy for
house dust mite-induced allergic rhinitis, with or without conjunctivitis,
confirmed by positive in vitro testing for immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies to house
dust mites or skin testing to licensed house dust mite allergen extracts.1 It is
approved for use in patients 5 to 65 years of age. Odactra is not indicated for the
immediate relief of allergic symptoms.
Clinical Efficacy
Pivotal trials of Odactra involved patients as young as 5 years of age with house dust
mite-induced allergic rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis.1-4 The house dust mite
sensitivity was confirmed by a positive skin test response to Dermatophagoides
pteronyssinus and/or D. farina and a specific IgE level of ≥ 0.7 kU/L against D.
pteronyssinus, D. farina or both.

dosing with other allergen immunotherapy may increase the risk of local or
systemic adverse events to either the subcutaneous or sublingual allergen
immunotherapy.
