CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Emgality, a calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist, is indicated in adults
for the following uses:1
• Episodic cluster headache treatment.
• Migraine headache prevention.
Disease Overview
Migraines have been defined as chronic or episodic. Chronic migraine is described
by the International Headache Society as headache occurring on ≥ 15 days/month
for > 3 months and has the features of migraine headache on ≥ 8 days/month.2
Episodic migraine is characterized by headaches that occur < 15 days/month.3
Episodic migraine is more common than chronic migraine; however, chronic migraine
is associated with a markedly greater personal and societal burden.

Emgality Prior Authorization Policy
Cluster headaches are associated with attacks of severe, strictly unilateral pain which
is orbital, supraorbital, temporal, or in any combination of these sites, lasting 15 to
180 minutes.2 The headaches occur from once every other day to eight times a day.
Cluster headache is considered among the most severe of the primary headache
disorders because of extreme pain, associated autonomic symptoms, and high attack
frequency.5 In addition, a large proportion of patients with cluster headache have
chronic cluster headache, which features only brief or no remission periods, and may
be particularly refractory to medical therapies.
Guidelines
An updated assessment of the preventive and acute treatment of migraine by
the American Headache Society (AHS) [2018; update 2021] reaffirms previous
migraine guidelines.6,7 Patients with migraine should be considered for preventive
treatment in the following situations: when attacks significantly interfere with
patients’ daily routines despite acute treatment; frequent attacks (≥ 4 monthly
headache days); at least moderate disability (Migraine Disability Assessment
[MIDAS] score ≥ 11 or six-item Headache Impact Test [HIT-6] score > 50);
contraindication to, failure, overuse, or adverse events with acute treatments; or
patient preference. Before developing a preventive treatment plan, the appropriate
use (e.g., drug type, route and timing of administration, frequency) of acute
treatments should be initiated and coupled with education and lifestyle modifications.
All patients with migraine should be offered a trial of acute treatment. Based on the
level of evidence for efficacy and the American Academy of Neurology scheme for
classification of evidence, the following oral treatments have established efficacy and
should be offered for migraine prevention: antiepileptic drugs (divalproex sodium,
valproate sodium, topiramate [not for women of childbearing potential without a
reliable method of birth control]); beta-blockers (metoprolol, propranolol,
timolol); and frovatriptan (for short-term preventive treatment of menstrual
migraine). The following treatments are probably effective and should be considered
for migraine prevention: antidepressants (amitriptyline, venlafaxine); beta-
blockers (atenolol, nadolol); and angiotensin receptor blockers (candesartan).
The AHS issued an update to their position statement (2024) specifically regarding
therapies targeting CGRP for the prevention of migraine.8 The evidence for the
efficacy, tolerability, and safety of CGRP-targeting migraine preventive therapies
(specifically, the monoclonal antibodies: Aimovig [erenumab-aooe subcutaneous
{SC} injection], Ajovy® [fremanezumab-vfrm SC injection], Emgality®
[galcanezumab-gnlm SC injection], and Vyepti® [eptinezumab-jjmr intravenous
infusion], and the gepants: Nurtec® ODT [rimegepant orally disintegrating tablets]
and Qulipta® [atogepant tablets]) is substantial and consistent across different
individual CGRP-targeting treatments. Extensive “real-world” clinical experience
corroborates clinical trials. This data indicates that the efficacy and tolerability of
CGRP-targeting therapies are equal to or greater than those of previous first-line
therapies. The CGRP-targeting therapies should be considered as a first-line
approach for migraine prevention along with previous first-line treatments without a
requirement for prior failure of other classes of migraine preventive treatment.
Additionally, Botox® (onabotulinumtoxinA SC injection) is considered a first-line
therapy for prevention of chronic migraine.

Emgality Prior Authorization Policy
The AHS has published evidence-based guidelines on the treatment of cluster
headache (2016).5 The guidelines recommend sumatriptan subcutaneous,
zolmitriptan nasal spray, and high flow oxygen for acute treatment. For prophylactic
therapy, suboccipital steroid injection has been established as effective for the
prophylactic therapy of episodic and chronic cluster headache (Level A). Lithium,
verapamil, and melatonin are considered possibly effective for the prophylactic
therapy of episodic and chronic cluster headache (Level C). Currently, there is
insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for frovatriptan and prednisone
(Level U).
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Emgality. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
• Emgality® (galcanezumab-gnlm subcutaneous injection – Lilly)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Episodic Cluster Headache Treatment. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
ALL of the following (A, B, C, and D):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) Patient has between one headache every other day and eight headaches per
day; AND
C) Patient has tried at least one standard prophylactic (preventive) pharmacologic
therapy for cluster headache; AND
Note: Examples of standard prophylactic (preventive) pharmacologic
therapies for cluster headache include lithium, verapamil, melatonin,
frovatriptan, prednisone, suboccipital steroid injection, topiramate, and
valproate.
D) According to the prescriber, patient has had inadequate efficacy or has
experienced adverse event(s) severe enough to warrant discontinuation of the
standard prophylactic (preventive) pharmacologic therapy.

2. Migraine Headache Prevention. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of
the following (A, B, and C):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) Patient has ≥ 4 migraine headache days per month (prior to initiating a
migraine-preventive medication); AND
C) If the patient is currently taking Emgality, the patient has had a significant
clinical benefit from the medication, as determined by the prescriber.
Note: Examples of significant clinical benefit include a reduction in the overall
number of migraine days per month or a reduction in number of severe
migraine days per month from the time that Emgality was initiated.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Emgality® (galcanezumab-gnlm subcutaneous injection – Lilly)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Acute Treatment of Migraine. Emgality has not been studied for the acute
treatment of migraine.
2. Concurrent use with another calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)
inhibitor being prescribed for migraine headache prevention.
Note: CGRP inhibitors that are indicated for migraine headache prevention include
Aimovig (erenumab-aooe subcutaneous injection), Ajovy (fremanezumab-vfrm
subcutaneous injection), Vyepti (eptinezumab-jjmr intravenous infusion), and
Qulipta (atogepant tablets). Ajovy, Aimovig, Emgality, and Vyepti are injectable
CGRP inhibitors for migraine prevention and have not been studied for use in
combination with another agent in the same class.9-11 Qulipta is an oral CGRP
inhibitor for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults.12
3. Concurrent use with Nurtec ODT (rimegepant sulfate orally disintegrating
tablet) when used as a preventive treatment of migraine. Nurtec ODT is
an oral CGRP inhibitor for the acute treatment of migraine and for the preventive
treatment of episodic migraine in adults.13
