INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Natpara, a replica of the endogenous parathyroid hormone, is indicated as an adjunct
to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with
hypoparathyroidism.1
Limitations of Use: Due to the potential risk of osteosarcoma, Natpara is
recommended only for patients who cannot be well-controlled on calcium
supplements and active forms of vitamin D alone.1 Natpara was not studied in
patients with hypoparathyroidism caused by calcium-sensing receptor mutations;
and Natpara was not studied in patients with acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism.
Before initiating and during therapy with Natpara, 25-hydroxyvitamin D stores should
be sufficient.1 In addition, before initiating Natpara, serum calcium concentration
should be > 7.5 mg/dL In the pivotal study, a responder to Natpara therapy was
defined as an individual who had: ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in the dose of
Page 1 of 4: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hypoparathyroidism (Natpara Prior
Authorization Policy)
active vitamin D, ≥ 50% reduction from baseline in the dose of oral calcium
supplementation, and an albumin-corrected total serum calcium concentration
between 7.5 mg/dL and 10.6 mg/dL.
Natpara has a Boxed Warning about the potential risk of osteosarcoma.1 Parathyroid
hormone has been shown to increase the incidence of osteosarcoma in male and
female rats; the risk was dependent on dose and treatment duration. A risk to
humans could not be excluded. Natpara is available only through a restricted Risk
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program; only certified healthcare
providers can prescribe and only certified pharmacies can dispense Natpara.
Note: Natpara continues to be unavailable except for select patients through a
Special Use Program. On October 3, 2022, the manufacturer (Takeda) released a
statement that it will discontinue manufacturing Natpara globally at the end of 2024
due to unresolved supply issues.2 Takeda will not re-commercialized Natpara in the
US (or globally). Beyond 2024, Takeda intends to supply available doses until
inventory is depleted or expired.2
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Natpara. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Natpara as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Natpara to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Natpara® (parathyroid hormone subcutaneous injection ( Shire-
NPS/Takeda)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence

the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve if the patient meets ALL of the following (i, ii, iii, and
iv):
i. Patient cannot be well-controlled on calcium supplements and active forms
of vitamin D alone; AND
ii. Patient’s 25-hydroxyvitamin D stores are sufficient (before initiating
Natpara therapy) according to the prescriber; AND

of vitamin D alone; AND
ii. Patient’s 25-hydroxyvitamin D stores are sufficient (during Natpara
therapy) according to the prescriber; AND
iii. Patient is responding to Natpara therapy, according to the prescriber.
Note: Response to Natpara therapy include reduction in the patient’s oral
calcium dose; reduction in the patient’s active vitamin D dose; maintenance
of a stable albumin-corrected total serum calcium concentration.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED

NPS/Takeda)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):

with acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism.
