INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Attruby, a transthyretin (TTR) stabilizer, is indicated for the treatment of the
cardiomyopathy of wild-type or variant TRR-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR-
CM) to reduce cardiovascular death and cardiovascular-related hospitalization in
adults.1 Studies excluded patients with New York Heart Association class IV
disease.2
Disease Overview
ATTR-CM is a progressive, debilitating, and life-threatening disease that may go
unrecognized and result in late-stage diagnosis.3,4 ATTR can be caused by an
acquired wild-type variant or be an inherited variant that alters the structure and
function of TTR. Genetic testing of the TTR gene is done to differentiate patients
with the wild-type vs. a genetic variant. Although patients with ATTR may present
with a variety of symptoms, neuropathy or cardiomyopathy are often the most
prominent symptoms. Patients may also present with a mixed phenotype and
exhibit signs of both neuropathy and cardiomyopathy. In ATTR-CM, the stability of
the TTR tetramer is altered, resulting in misfolding of the TTR protein. This leads to
accumulation of amyloid in the body, most commonly the myocardium and
peripheral nerves. As a result of amyloid deposits in cardiac tissue and causes the
heart muscle becomes stiff and rigid. Although the clinical course varies, patients
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Amyloidosis – Acoramidis Prior Authorization Policy
typically exhibit heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. However, some
patients may present with right-sided heart failure, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis
and complete heart block, angina, or cardiogenic shock.
Guidelines
Attruby is currently not addressed in guidelines. The American Heart Association
(AHA) scientific statement for the evolving diagnosis and management of cardiac
amyloidosis (2020) recognizes tafamidis as a treatment for ATTR-CM.5 They note
that the benefit of tafamidis has not been observed in patients with NYHA class IV
symptoms. Additionally, although combination use of tafamidis with Onpattro®
(patisiran lipid complex intravenous infusion) or Tegsedi® (inotersen subcutaneous
injection) is appealing to target both TTR silencing and stabilization for the
remaining synthesized protein, this approach lacks data and may be cost-
prohibitive. Tafamidis should generally be considered the agent of choice in ATTR-
CM in patients with reasonable expected survival according to a position statement
of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) working group on myocardial and
pericardial disease (2021).6 The working group notes that tafamidis is the only
drug that has shown efficacy in a randomized trial in patients with ATTR-CM and
should be considered in patients with reasonable expected survival. The American
College of Cardiology (ACC) expert consensus decision pathway on comprehensive
multidisciplinary care for patients with cardiac amyloidosis (2023) make similar
comments and recommendations to the AHA and ESC regarding tafamidis.7
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Attruby. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Attruby as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial
approval requires the agent to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician
who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Attruby (acoramidis tablets – Bridgebio)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Cardiomyopathy of Wild-Type or Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated
Amyloidosis (ATTR-CM). Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of the
following (A, B, C, D, and E):
Note: Variant Transthyretin Amyloidosis is also known as Hereditary
Transthyretin Amyloidosis.
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
2 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Amyloidosis – Acoramidis Prior Authorization Policy
B) The diagnosis was confirmed by ONE of the following (i, ii, or iii):
i. A technetium pyrophosphate scan (i.e., nuclear scintigraphy); OR
ii. A tissue biopsy with confirmatory transthyretin (TTR) amyloid typing by
mass spectrometry, immunoelectron microscopy or
immunohistochemistry; OR
iii. Patient had genetic testing which, according to the prescriber, identified a
transthyretin (TTR) pathogenic variant; AND
Note: Examples of TTR variants include Val122Ile variant and Thr60Ala
variant. If the patient has wild-type amyloidosis, this is not a TTR
pathogenic variant.
C) Diagnostic cardiac imaging has demonstrated cardiac involvement; AND
Note: Examples of cardiac imaging include echocardiogram and cardiac
magnetic imaging. Examples of cardiac involvement on imaging include
increased thickness of the ventricular wall or interventricular septum.
D) Patient has heart failure, but does not have New York Heart Association class
IV disease; AND
E) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a cardiologist or a
physician who specializes in the treatment of amyloidosis.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Attruby (acoramidis tablets – Bridgebio)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concurrent use with other medications indicated for the treatment of
polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis or
transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis-cardiomyopathy (e.g., Amvuttra
[vutrisiran subcutaneous injection], Onpattro [patisiran intravenous
infusion], Tegsedi [inotersen subcutaneous injection], Wainua
[eplontersen subcutaneous injection], or a tafamidis product).
The requested medication should not be administered in combination with other
medications indicated for polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated
amyloidosis or transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis-cardiomyopathy.
Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to a lack of controlled
clinical trial data supporting additive efficacy.
2. Polyneuropathy of Hereditary Transthyretin–Mediated Amyloidosis
(hATTR). Attruby is not indicated for treatment of symptoms of
polyneuropathy associated with hATTR.1
Note: For patients with hATTR and cardiomyopathy or mixed phenotype
(concurrent cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy), refer to FDA-Approved
Indication, above.
