CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Adbry, an interleukin (IL)-13 antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of moderate
to severe atopic dermatitis in patients ≥ 12 years of age whose disease is not
adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are
not advisable.1 Adbry may be used with or without topical corticosteroids.
Clinical Efficacy
Three pivotal Adbry studies enrolled adults (≥ 18 years of age) with moderate to
severe chronic atopic dermatitis affecting ≥ 10% of their body surface area (BSA).1-
3 Patients also had a recent history of an inadequate response to a sufficient course
of topical therapy (e.g., topical corticosteroids and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors).
Inadequate response was defined as a failure to either achieve or maintain remission
or low disease activity following at least 28 days of topical corticosteroid treatment
(medium potency or higher) or for the maximum duration recommended by the
topical corticosteroid prescribing information, with or without a topical calcineurin
Page 1 of 5 Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Immunologicals – Adbry Prior Authorization Policy
inhibitor. Patients who had received systemic treatment for atopic dermatitis in the
previous year were also considered to be non-responders to topical therapies and
were eligible for study inclusion. At Week 16, Adbry was found to be more effective
in achieving a clinical response compared with placebo. In the monotherapy trials,
the majority of patients who achieved a clinical response to Adbry at Week 16
experienced sustained efficacy at Week 52. Similarly, the patients enrolled in the
Adbry pivotal trial in adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) had moderate to severe
atopic dermatitis affecting 10% BSA or more and a previous inadequate response to
topical medication (e.g., topical corticosteroids and/or topical calcineurin inhibitors).4
As was observed in trials in adults, significantly more patients achieved a clinical
response at Week 16 and again, efficacy was sustained through Week 52.
Guidelines
Guidelines for the care and management of atopic dermatitis (with topical therapies
in adults [2022], with phototherapy and systemic agents [2023]) have been updated
to address Adbry.5,6 The guidelines note that despite the availability of newer,
systemic therapies (e.g., Adbry), topical agents remain the mainstay of treatment
due to their proven track record and favorable safety profiles. Several topical agents
are recommended, with topical corticosteroids commonly used first-line for mild to
severe atopic dermatitis in all skin regions. If topical therapy and basic management
(e.g., moisturizers, bathing modifications) have been optimized and the patient has
not achieved adequate control, consider an alternative diagnosis or systemic therapy.
In this setting, use of Adbry is recommended in patients with moderate to severe
disease (strong recommendation).
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Adbry. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Adbry as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Adbry to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes
in the condition being treated.
• Adbry® (tralokinumab-ldrm subcutaneous injection – Leo)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Atopic Dermatitis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets one of
the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 4 months if the patient meets the following (i, ii,
iii, and iv):
i. Patient is ≥ 12 years of age; AND
Page 2 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Immunologicals – Adbry Prior Authorization Policy
ii. Patient has atopic dermatitis involvement estimated to be ≥ 10% of the
body surface area according to the prescriber; AND
iii. Patient meets ALL of the following (a, b, and c):
a) Patient has tried at least one medium-, medium-high, high-, and/or
super-high-potency prescription topical corticosteroid; AND
b) This topical corticosteroid was applied daily for at least 28 consecutive
days; AND
c) Inadequate efficacy was demonstrated with this topical corticosteroid
therapy, according to the prescriber; AND
iv. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an allergist,
immunologist, or dermatologist.
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Adbry. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
the following (i and ii):
i. Patient has already received at least 4 months of therapy with Adbry; AND
Note: A patient who has received < 4 months of therapy or who is restarting
therapy with Adbry should be considered under criterion 1A (Atopic
Dermatitis, Initial Therapy).
ii. Patient has responded to therapy as determined by the prescriber.
Note: Examples of a response to Adbry therapy are marked improvements
in erythema, induration/papulation/edema, excoriations, and
lichenification; reduced pruritus; decreased requirement for other topical
or systemic therapies; reduced body surface area affected with atopic
dermatitis; or other observed responses.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Adbry® (tralokinumab-ldrm subcutaneous injection – Leo)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Asthma. Adbry is not indicated for the treatment of asthma.1 Three Phase III
studies evaluated tralokinumab for the treatment of adults and adolescent
patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma.7,8 In STRATOS 1 and STRATOS 2
(published) [n = 1,202], Adbry 300 mg administered subcutaneously once every
2 weeks did not significantly reduce the annualized asthma exacerbation rate
compared with placebo.7 TROPOS (published) [n = 140] included patients with
severe, uncontrolled asthma that required maintenance oral corticosteroid
treatment plus inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled long-acting beta -agonists.8
2
Following 40 weeks of therapy, the percent reduction from baseline in the final
daily average oral corticosteroid dose was not significantly different between
Adbry and placebo.
2. Concurrent use of Adbry with another Monoclonal Antibody Therapy. The
efficacy and safety of Adbry in combination with other monoclonal antibodies have
not been established.
Page 3 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Immunologicals – Adbry Prior Authorization Policy
Note: Monoclonal antibody therapies are Dupixent® (dupilumab subcutaneous
[SC] injection), Cinqair® (reslizumab intravenous injection), Ebglyss®
(lebrikizumab-lbkz subcutaneous injection), Fasenra® (benralizumab SC
injection), Nemluvio® (nemolizumab-ilto subcutaneous injection), Nucala®
(mepolizumab SC injection), Tezspire® (tezepelumab-ekko SC injection), or
Xolair® (omalizumab SC injection).
3. Concurrent Use of Adbry with Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitors (oral or
topical). Use of JAK inhibitors is not recommended in combination with other JAK
inhibitors, biologic immunomodulators (e.g., Adbry), or with other
immunosuppressants.9-11,14
Note: Examples of JAK inhibitors are Cibinqo® (abrocitinib tablets), Leqselvi™
(deuruxolitinib tablets), Rinvoq®/Rinvoq® LQ (upadacitinib extended-release
tablets and oral solution), and Opzelura™ (ruxolitinib cream).
4. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. Adbry is not indicated for the treatment of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.1 Intravenous tralokinumab has been studied for
the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in a Phase II, randomized, placebo-
controlled study (published) [n = 176].12 However, this study was terminated
early after an interim analysis showed lack of efficacy. Two doses of tralokinumab
were studied and neither dose significantly improved the least-squares mean
difference percent predicted forced vital capacity from baseline to Week 52.
5. Ulcerative Colitis. Adbry is not indicated for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.1
One Phase IIa, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (published) [n
= 111] evaluated tralokinumab for the treatment of patients with moderate to
severe ulcerative colitis despite standard treatments.13 Following 8 weeks of
therapy, tralokinumab did not significantly improve clinical response rates
compared with placebo.
