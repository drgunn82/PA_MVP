INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is a fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir, a hepatitis C virus
(HCV) NS5A inhibitor, and sofosbuvir, an HCV nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase
inhibitor.1 It is indicated for the treatment of chronic HCV in patients ≥ 3 years of
age in the following instances:
• Genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis; and
• Genotype 1 infection with decompensated cirrhosis in combination with
ribavirin; and
• Genotype 1 or 4 infection who are liver transplant recipients with or without
compensated cirrhosis, in combination with ribavirin.
Dosing
In adults, the recommended dosage of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is one tablet (90
mg/400 mg) taken orally once daily with or without food.1
The recommended dose of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir tablets or pellets in pediatric
patients ≥ 3 years of age is based on weight (Table 1).1 The ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
pellets can be taken in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet

Availability
Brand Harvoni is available as a tablet containing 90 mg of ledipasvir/400 mg
sofosbuvir or 45 mg/ledipasvir/200 mg sofosbuvir.1 It is also available as an oral
pellet packet formulation containing 45 mg ledipasvir/200 mg sofosbuvir or 33.75
mg ledipasvir/150 mg sofosbuvir. The ledipasvir/sofosbuvir authorized generic is

Guidelines
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases
Society of America have simplified recommendations for the management of
chronic HCV in adults (December 19, 2023).2 In treatment-naïve adults without
cirrhosis, the recommended regimens are Mavyret® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hepatitis C – Harvoni Drug Quantity Management Policy –
Per Days
tablets and oral pellets) for 8 weeks or Epclusa® (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir tablets
[generic] and oral pellets) for 12 weeks. In treatment-naïve adults with
compensated cirrhosis, the recommended regimens are Mavyret for 8 weeks
(genotypes 1 through 6) or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks (genotypes 1, 2, 4,
5, or 6; patients with genotype 3 require baseline NS5A resistance-associated
substitution testing and those without Y93H can be treated with 12 weeks of
Epclusa). Additional genotype-specific and/or special circumstance-specific
recommendations are also provided for patients falling outside of these parameters.
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir continues to be recommended in various situations as
outlined below in Table 3.
