INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Pregabalin extended-release tablets, an analog of gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA), are indicated for the following uses:1
• Neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy
(DPN), management in adults.
• Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), management in adults.
The efficacy of pregabalin extended-release tablets has not been established for the
management of fibromyalgia or as adjunctive therapy for adults with partial onset
seizures.1
Gabapentin immediate-release (IR), an analog of GABA, is indicated for the
following uses:2
• Partial onset seizures, with and without secondary generalization, as
adjunctive therapy in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 3 years of age with
epilepsy.
• PHN, management in adults.
Pregabalin IR capsules and oral solution are indicated for the following uses:3

Therapy Policy
• Fibromyalgia, management in adults.
• Neuropathic pain associated with DPN, management in adults.
• Neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury, management in
adults.
• Partial onset seizures, as adjunctive therapy for the treatment in patients
≥ 1 month of age.
• PHN, management in adults.
Disease Overview
PHN is the persistence of the pain of herpes zoster > 3 months after resolution of
the rash; it is relatively common, affecting 10% to 15% of those with herpes
zoster.4 Administration of antiviral agents within 72 hours of the onset of herpes
zoster can reduce the intensity and duration of acute illness and can prevent PHN.
Efforts to prevent herpes zoster and PHN are important because 40% to 50% of
patients with PHN do not respond to any treatment.
The diabetic neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of disorders with diverse
clinical manifestations.5 The early recognition and appropriate management of
neuropathy in the patient with diabetes is important. Up to 50% of DPN may be
asymptomatic. Painful diabetic neuropathy affects 16% of patients with diabetes,
and it is frequently unreported (12.5%) and more frequently untreated (39%).6 If
not recognized and if preventive foot care is not implemented, patients are at risk
for injuries to their insensate feet.5 Recognition and treatment of autonomic
neuropathy may improve symptoms, reduce sequelae, and improve quality of life.
Therapeutic strategies (pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic) for the relief of
painful DPN can potentially reduce pain and improve quality of life.
Guidelines
Various guidelines for the treatment of DPN, neuropathic pain, PHN, and restless
legs syndrome recommend gabapentin or pregabalin immediate-release as
treatment options.4-11 Guidelines do not address pregabalin extended-release
tablets.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of pregabalin
extended-release tablets. Additionally, due to the availability of generic pregabalin
extended-release tablets, approval of a branded pregabalin extended-release
product requires a previous trial of the generic. All approvals are provided for the
duration noted below.
• Lyrica® CR (pregabalin extended-release tablets - Pfizer, generic)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
4 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Neurology – Lyrica CR Prior Authorization with Step
Therapy Policy
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Neuropathic Pain Associated with Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy.
Approve pregabalin extended-release tablets for 1 year if the patient meets the
following (A and B):
A) Patient has tried gabapentin immediate-release (brand [Neurontin] or generic)
or generic immediate-release pregabalin; AND
B) If brand Lyrica CR is requested, the patient meets BOTH of the following (i and
ii):
i. Patient has tried generic pregabalin extended-release tablets; AND
ii. Patient cannot continue to use the generic due to a formulation difference
in the inactive ingredient(s) [e.g., differences in dyes, fillers, preservatives]
between the brand and the bioequivalent generic product, which, according
to the prescriber, would result in a significant allergy or serious adverse
reaction.
2. Postherpetic Neuralgia. Approve pregabalin extended-release tablets for 1
year if the patient meets the following (A and B):
A) Patient has tried gabapentin immediate-release (brand [Neurontin] or generic)
or generic immediate-release pregabalin; AND
B) If brand Lyrica CR is requested, the patient meets BOTH of the following (i and
ii):
i. Patient has tried generic pregabalin extended-release tablets; AND
ii. Patient cannot continue to use the generic due to a formulation difference
in the inactive ingredient(s) [e.g., differences in dyes, fillers, preservatives]
between the brand and the bioequivalent generic product, which, according
to the prescriber, would result in a significant allergy or serious adverse
reaction.

is(are) considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for ANY
other use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive;
criteria will be updated as new published data are available):
1. Fibromyalgia. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal trial
of pregabalin extended-release tablets in adults with fibromyalgia failed to
demonstrate efficacy.1
2. Partial Onset Seizures. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial
of pregabalin extended-release tablets as adjunctive therapy in adults with
partial onset seizures failed to demonstrate efficacy.1
