INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Tremfya, an interleukin (IL)-23 blocker, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Crohn’s disease, in adults with moderate to severe active disease.
• Plaque psoriasis, in adults with moderate to severe disease who are
candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
• Psoriatic arthritis, in adults with active disease (given ± a conventional
synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug).
• Ulcerative colitis, in adults with moderate to severe active disease.
Guidelines
IL blockers are mentioned in guidelines for treatment of inflammatory conditions.
• Crohn’s Disease: The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) [2025]
has guidelines for the management of Crohn’s disease in adults.7 In moderate
Page 1 of 9 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Tremfya Subcutaneous Prior
Authorization Policy
to severe disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be
utilized for induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended include
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, Entyvio® (vedolizumab), IL-23
inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, and Rinvoq® (upadacitinib). If steroids are
utilized for induction, efforts should be made to introduce steroid-sparing
agents for maintenance therapy. Guidelines from the American
Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [2021] include biologics among the
therapies for moderate to severe Crohn’s disease, for induction and
maintenance of remission.8
• Plaque Psoriasis: Joint guidelines from the American Academy of
Dermatology and National Psoriasis Medical Board (2019) have been published
for management of psoriasis with biologics.2 These guidelines list Tremfya as
a monotherapy treatment option for patients with moderate to severe plaque
psoriasis. It is recommended that a response to therapy be ascertained after
12 weeks of continuous therapy. Guidelines from the European Dermatology
Forum (2015) recommend biologics (i.e., etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab,
Stelara® [ustekinumab subcutaneous injection]) as second-line therapy for
induction and long-term treatment if phototherapy and conventional systemic
agents have failed, are contraindicated, or are not tolerated.3
• Psoriatic Arthritis: Guidelines from the American College of
Rheumatology/National Psoriasis Foundation (2018) were published prior to
approval of Tremfya for psoriatic arthritis. However, these guidelines generally
recommend tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors as the first-line treatment
strategy over other biologics (e.g., IL-17 blockers, IL-12/23 inhibitor) with
differing mechanisms of action.4
• Ulcerative colitis: The AGA (2024) and ACG (2025) have clinical practice
guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in
adults.5,6 In moderate to severe disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced
therapies may be utilized for induction of remission. Advanced therapies
recommended include TNF inhibitors, Entyvio, IL-23 inhibitors, IL-12/23
inhibitors, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, and Janus
kinase (JAK) inhibitors. If steroids are utilized for induction, efforts should be
made to introduce steroid-sparing agents for maintenance therapy. Of note,
guidelines state corticosteroids may be avoided entirely when other effective
induction strategies are planned.6 Both guidelines also recommend that any
drug that effectively treats induction should be continued for maintenance.5,6
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Tremfya. All
approvals are for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is authorized
in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills required for
evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Tremfya as well as the monitoring
required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval requires Tremfya
to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition
being treated.

Authorization Policy
• Tremfya® (guselkumab subcutaneous injection – Janssen

b) Patient has tried one other conventional systemic therapy for Crohn’s
disease; OR
Note: Examples of conventional systemic therapy for Crohn’s disease
include azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate. An exception
to the requirement for a trial of or contraindication to steroids or a trial
of one other conventional systemic agent can be made if the patient has
already tried at least one biologic other than the requested medication.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Tremfya® (guselkumab subcutaneous injection – Janssen
Biotech/Johnson & Johnson)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (e.g., methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or
sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication.
