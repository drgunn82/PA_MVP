INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Anzupgo, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is indicated for the topical treatment of
moderate to severe chronic hand eczema in patients ≥ 18 years of age who have
had an inadequate response to topical corticosteroids or for whom topical
corticosteroids are not advisable.1
Limitation of Use: Use of Anzupgo in combination with other JAK inhibitors or potent
immunosuppressants is not recommended.
Clinical Efficacy
Two pivotal Anzupgo studies enrolled patients ≥ 18 years of age with hand eczema
that was present for > 3 months or returned twice or more within the previous 12
month period.2 Patients had experienced an inadequate response to treatment with
a topical corticosteroid in the previous year (99% of patients), except for patients for
whom topical corticosteroids were deemed medically inadvisable (1% of patients).
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Dermatology – Anzupgo Prior Authorization Policy
An inadequate response was the failure to maintain clear or almost clear skin despite
daily topical corticosteroid application for ≥ 28 days or for the maximum duration
recommended by the product prescribing information, whichever was shorter. A
potent to very potent topical corticosteroid was required in Europe, while a medium-
to ultra-high potency topical corticosteroid was required in Canada. Patients who had
previously received treatment with a systemic or topical JAK inhibitor were excluded
from study participation. The primary endpoint was evaluated following 16 weeks of
treatment.
Guidelines
The European Society of Contact Dermatitis guidelines for the diagnosis, prevention,
and treatment of hand eczema (2022) have not been updated since the approval of
Anzupgo and list it as a possible future treatment.3 Following secondary prevention
strategies, topical corticosteroids are recommended for short-term, first-line
treatment of hand eczema. Intermittent, long-term use of topical corticosteroids may
be considered for chronic disease.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Anzupgo
cream. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the
approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Anzupgo cream as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, approval requires Anzupgo cream to be prescribed by or in consultation with
a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Anzupgo® (delgocitinib 2% cream – LEO)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Chronic Hand Eczema. Approve for 4 months if the patient meets ALL of the
following (A, B, C, D, and E):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) Patient has hand eczema that has been present for > 3 months or has returned
at least twice in a year after its initial presentation and subsequent clearance;
AND
C) According to the prescriber, patient has moderate to severe chronic hand
eczema; AND
D) Patient meets ALL of the following (i, ii, and iii):
i. Patient has tried at least one medium-, medium-high, high-, and/or super-
high-potency prescription topical corticosteroid; AND
ii. This topical corticosteroid was applied daily for at least 28 consecutive
days; AND

iii. According to the prescriber, inadequate efficacy was demonstrated with this
topical corticosteroid therapy; OR
E) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an allergist,
immunologist, or dermatologist.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Anzupgo® (delgocitinib 2% cream – LEO)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with other JAK inhibitors. Use of Anzupgo in combination with
other JAK inhibitors is not recommended (see Appendix for examples).1 Use of
other topical or systemic JAK inhibitors was prohibited prior to and during the
Anzupgo pivotal studies.2 There are no data evaluating combination use of
Anzupgo with these therapies; therefore, safety and efficacy of these
combinations are unknown.
2. Concurrent use with Potent Immunosuppressants. Use of Anzupgo in
combination with potent immunosuppressants is not recommended.1 Use of
systemic immunosuppressants was prohibited during the Anzupgo pivotal
studies.2 There are no data evaluating combination of Anzupgo with these
therapies; therefore, safety and efficacy of these combinations are unknown.
