INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES

CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is a fixed-dose combination of ledipasvir, a hepatitis C virus (HCV)
NS5A inhibitor, and sofosbuvir, an HCV nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor. It is
indicated for the treatment of chronic HCV infection in patients ≥ 3 years of age in the
following instances:1
• Genotype 1, 4, 5, or 6 infections with or without compensated cirrhosis; and
• Genotype 1 infection with decompensated cirrhosis, in combination with ribavirin;
and
• Genotype 1 or 4 infection who are liver transplant recipients with or without
compensated cirrhosis, in combination with ribavirin.
Dosing
In adults, the recommended dose of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir is one tablet taken orally once
daily with or without food.1 The recommended dose of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir tablets or
pellets in pediatric patients ≥ 3 years of age is based on weight. The ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
pellets can be taken in pediatric patients who cannot swallow the tablet formulation. Table 1
below provides the recommended duration of therapy with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. The
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir authorized generic is only available in the 90 mg/400 mg strength
tablet; Harvoni is additionally available as a lower strength tablet (45 mg/200 mg) as well
as oral pellets (45 mg/200 mg and 33.75 mg/150 mg).

ribavirin or a hepatitis C virus protease inhibitor + peginterferon + ribavirin; † Harvoni for
12 weeks can be considered in treatment-experienced patients with cirrhosis who are
eligible for ribavirin. The daily dose of ribavirin is weight-based (1,000 mg for patients < 75
kg and 1,200 mg for those ≥ 75 kg) administered in two divided doses. ‡ In patients with
decompensated cirrhosis, the starting dosage of ribavirin is 600 mg and can be titrated up
to 1,000 mg for patients < 75 kg and 1,200 mg for those ≥ 75 kg in two divided doses with
food. If the starting dosage of ribavirin is not well tolerated, the dosage should be reduced
as clinically indicated based on hemoglobin levels. § The daily dosage of ribavirin is weight-
based (1,000 mg for patients < 75 kg and 1,200 mg for those ≥ 75 kg) administered orally
in two divided doses with food.
Guidelines
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of
America have simplified recommendations for the management of chronic HCV in adults
(December 19, 2023).2 In treatment-naïve adults without cirrhosis, the recommended
regimens are Mavyret® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir tablets and oral pellets) for 8 weeks or
Epclusa® (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir tablets [generic] and oral pellets) for 12 weeks. In
treatment-naïve adults with compensated cirrhosis, the recommended regimens are
Mavyret for 8 weeks (genotypes 1 through 6) or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks
(genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6; patients with genotype 3 require baseline NS5A resistance-
associated substitution testing and those without Y93H can be treated with 12 weeks of
Epclusa). Additional genotype-specific and/or special circumstance-specific
recommendations are also provided for patients falling outside of these parameters.
Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir continues to be recommended in various situations as outlined below
in Table 2.

POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of

efficacy, approval requires ledipasvir/sofosbuvir to be prescribed by or in consultation with a
physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
