CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Beta-blockers can be classified into four pharmacologic subgroups based on their
effect on beta and alpha receptors: cardioselective beta-blockers, nonselective
beta-blockers, combined alpha-beta blockers, and beta-blockers with intrinsic
sympathomimetic activity (ISA).1-4 Cardioselective beta-blockers are those agents
that preferentially block beta-1 receptors over beta-2 receptors. Non-selective
beta-blockers block both the beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. Based on the
mechanism of action, cardioselective beta-blockers may be safer than nonselective
beta-blockers in patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
peripheral arterial disease, and diabetes mellitus who require beta-blocker therapy.
However, cardioselectivity appears to be dose-dependent and at higher doses,
cardioselective agents may lose their selectivity. The dose at which
cardioselectivity is lost varies from patient to patient. Combined alpha-beta
blockers nonselectively block beta receptors as well as alpha receptors. Beta-
blockers with ISA act as partial beta-receptor agonists and therefore, resting heart
rate, cardiac output, and peripheral blood flow are not as reduced. Table 1
classifies the beta-blockers by subgroup.

8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Beta Blocker Step Therapy Policy
All of the beta-blockers included in this policy are approved for the treatment of
hypertension. Various reviews and guidelines address the role of beta-blockers in
hypertension.1-8 Betaxolol, bisoprolol, labetalol, Bystolic™ (nebivolol tablets),
Levatol® (penbutalol tablets), and pindolol are only indicated for the treatment of
hypertension.1-9 The remaining beta-blockers (non-combination products) have at
least one other indication. Such indications include angina pectoris, select
arrhythmias, to treat and reduce cardiovascular (CV) mortality following a
myocardial infarction (MI), to treat and reduce CV mortality in heart failure (HF),
migraine prophylaxis, essential tremor, pheochromocytoma, and hypertrophic
subaortic stenosis. All of the beta-blocker/diuretic combination products are
indicated for the treatment of hypertension, although often not as initial therapy. It
is notable that sotalol (Betapace, Betapace AF) is not indicated for use in
hypertension but instead is used for the management of arrhythmias.3,4,10
Specifically, Betapace/Betapace AF are indicated for the treatment of life-
threatening ventricular arrhythmias as well as for the maintenance of normal sinus
rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter.10 Sotylize™ (sotalol
hydrochloride oral solution) is not included in this program as a generic is not
available.3,4,11 Also, Hemangeol™ (propranolol hydrochloride oral solution) is not
included as this is indicated for the treatment of proliferating infantile hemangioma
requiring systemic therapy.12
Carvedilol, metoprolol succinate extended-release (XL) and Coreg CR™ (carvedilol
extended-release capsules) are the only beta-blockers indicated in patients with
HF14-16 with published data to support their use.17-20 Metoprolol succinate XL is
indicated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and HF hospitalization in
patients with HF.14 Carvedilol and Coreg CR are indicated for the treatment of mild
to severe HF of ischemic or cardiomyopathic origin.15,16 In combination with
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, diuretics, and digitalis, both metoprolol
succinate and carvedilol have been shown to decrease the rate of mortality and
hospitalization. In addition, carvedilol and Coreg CR are indicated to reduce CV
mortality in clinically stable patients who have survived the acute phase of an MI
and have a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 40% with or without symptomatic HF.
Data are available with bisoprolol in patients with HF.21
Guidelines
Beta blockers are mentioned in a variety of guidelines. Main guidelines are briefly
summarized.
• Heart Failure: In 2022, the American Heart Association (AHA), American
College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Heart Failure Society of America
published guidelines for the management of HF.22 The three beta-blockers
proven to reduce mortality in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction
are bisoprolol, carvedilol, and sustained-release metoprolol succinate.
Hospitalization can also be reduced with these agents.
• Hypertension: The 2017 guidelines regarding the management of high
blood pressure in adults by the ACC and the AHA prominently mention the
benefits with beta blockers in selected patients.7
• Chronic Coronary Disease: Guidelines for the management of patients
with chronic coronary disease (CCD) from the AHA and the ACC (2023) state
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Beta Blocker Step Therapy Policy
that in adults with CCD and hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 130
and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg), in addition to
nonpharmacological strategies, guideline-directed medication therapy with
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARB), or beta blockers are recommended as first-line therapy for
compelling indications (e.g., recent MI or angina), with additional
antihypertensive medications (e.g., dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
[CCB], long-acting thiazide diuretics, and/or mineralocorticoid receptor
antagonists) added as needed to optimize blood pressure control.13 In
patients with CCD and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 40% with or
without previous MI, the use of beta-blocker therapy is recommended to
reduce the risk of future major adverse CV events, including CV death. Also,
in patients with CCD and LVEF < 50%, the use of sustained release
metoprolol succinate, carvedilol, or bisoprolol with titration to target doses is
recommended in preference to other beta blockers.
POLICY STATEMENT
The program is comprised of two rules: 1) Beta-Blocker Step Therapy rule (Step A)
and 2) Sotalol Step Therapy rule (Step B). This program has been developed to
encourage the use of a Step 1A product prior to a Step 2A Product and a Step 1B
Product prior to the use of a Step 2B Product. If the Step Therapy rule is not met
for the Step 2A or Step 2B Product at the point of service, coverage will be
determined by the Step Therapy criteria below. All approvals are provided for 1
year in duration.

release, propranolol extended-release), and generic beta-blocker
combination products (i.e., atenolol/chlorthalidone,
metoprolol/hydrochlorothiazide, propranolol/hydrochlorothiazide,)
Step 2A: brand name beta-blockers (i.e., Bystolic, Tenormin, Coreg, Coreg CR,
