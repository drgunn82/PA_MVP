CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Elyxyb, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is indicated for the acute
treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults.1 Limitations of Use:
Elyxyb is not indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine.
Disease Overview
Migraine is a common, ongoing condition marked by paroxysmal, unilateral attacks
of moderate to severe throbbing headache which are aggravated by routine physical
activity (e.g., walking or climbing stairs) and associated with nausea, vomiting,
and/or photophobia and phonophobia.2 Migraines have been defined as chronic or
episodic. Chronic migraine is described by the International Headache Society as
headache occurring on ≥ 15 days/month for more than 3 months, which has the
features of migraine headache on ≥ 8 days/month. Episodic migraine is characterized
by headaches that occur < 15 days/month.3
Guidelines
Triptans (e.g., almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan,
sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan) are considered the gold standard for acute treatment
of moderate to severe migraine headaches or mild to moderate migraine headaches
that respond poorly to over-the-counter analgesics. An assessment of the preventive
Page 1 of 3 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Migraine – Elyxyb Prior Authorization Policy
and acute treatment of migraine by the American Headache Society (2018; updated
2021) reaffirms previous migraine guidelines.4,5 NSAIDs as a class are mentioned as
an option for acute treatment of mild to moderate migraine attacks; celecoxib is not
specifically addressed. The potential for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse
events with NSAID use is noted. Other treatment options in the mild to moderate
setting include nonopioid analgesics, acetaminophen, or caffeinated analgesic
combinations. For moderate to severe attacks or attacks which respond poorly to
NSAIDs or caffeinated combinations, the update lists the triptans,
dihydroergotamine, the oral gepants (Nurtec® ODT [rimegepant orally disintegrating
tablets,] and Ubrelvy® [ubrogepant tablets]), and Reyvow™ (lasmiditan tablet) as
effective treatments. The recommendation remains that clinicians must consider
medication efficacy and potential medication-related adverse events when
prescribing acute medications for migraine.
