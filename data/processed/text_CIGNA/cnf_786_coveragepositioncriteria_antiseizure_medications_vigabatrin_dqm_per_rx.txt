INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Sabril (generic), Vigadrone (generic), and Vigpoder (generic), antiseizure
medications, are indicated for the following uses:1,2
• Refractory complex partial seizures as adjunctive therapy in adults and
pediatric patients ≥ 2 years of age who have inadequately responded to
several alternative treatments and for whom the potential benefits outweigh
the risk of vision loss. Vigabatrin is not indicated as a first line agent for
complex partial seizures.
• Infantile spasms as monotherapy in pediatric patients 1 month to 2 years
of age for whom the potential benefits outweigh the potential risk of vision
loss.

Management Policy – Per Rx
Vigafyde is indicated for infantile spasms as monotherapy in pediatric patients 1
month to 2 years of age for whom the potential benefits outweigh the potential risk
of vision loss.4
Dosing and Administration
Vigabatrin’s dosing regimen depends on the indication, age group, weight, and
dosage form (i.e., tablets or powder for oral solution).1 Patients with impaired
renal function require dose adjustment. Vigabatrin may be taken with or without
food. Vigabatrin powder for oral solution should be mixed with water prior to
administration. A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and
deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not
an adequate measuring device. When discontinuing vigabatrin, the dose should be
gradually reduced.
Refractory Complex Partial Seizures
Adults (Patients ≥ 17 Years of Age)
Treatment with vigabatrin should be initiated at 1,000 mg per day (500 mg twice
daily [BID]).1,2 Total daily dose may be increased in 500 mg increments at weekly
intervals, depending on response. The recommended dose of vigabatrin in adults is
3,000 mg per day (1,500 mg BID). However, doses up to 6,000 mg per day have
been studied.1,3 According to current guidelines, vigabatrin doses of 1 , 3, and 6
grams per day yielded significant higher responder rates and larger reductions in
monthly seizure frequency.3 Fatigue and drowsiness are the most frequent adverse
events, with higher drug discontinuation in the 6 gram per day group.
Pediatric (Patients 2 to 16 Years of Age)
The recommended dosage of vigabatrin is based on body weight and administered
as two divided doses.1,2 The dosage may be increased in weekly intervals to the
total daily maintenance dosage, depending on response (Table 1). Pediatric
patients weighing > 60 kg should be dosed according to adult recommendations.
Table 1: Dosing Recommendations for Vigabatrin in Pediatric Patients Weighing 10 kg up to
60 kg.1
Body Weight Recommended Total Daily Maintenance Dose
10 kg to 15 kg 1,050 mg/day
> 15 kg to 20 kg 1,300 mg/day
> 20 kg to 25 kg 1,500 mg/day
> 25 kg to 60 kg 2,000 mg/day
Infantile Spasms (patients 1 month to 2 years of age)
The initial daily dosage of vigabatrin is 25 mg/kg BID (50 mg/kg/day); subsequent
dosing can be titrated by 25 mg/kg/day to 50 mg/kg/day increments every 3 days,
up to a maximum of 75 mg/kg BID (150 mg/kg/day).1,2,4 See Table 2 for dosing for
vigabatrin 50 mg/ mL products (Sabril [generic], Vigadrone [generic], and Vigpoder
[generic]).1 Table 3 presents dosing for Vygafyde (100 mg/ml vigabatrin).4
