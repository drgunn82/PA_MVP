INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Posaconazole, an azole antifungal, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Prophylaxis of invasive Aspergillus and Candida infections in patients
who are at high risk of developing these infections due to being severely
immunocompromised, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
recipients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or those with hematologic
malignancies with prolonged neutropenia from chemotherapy: delayed-
release tablets, in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 2 years of age who weigh >
40 kg; oral suspension, in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 13 years of age;
Noxafil PowderMix for delayed-release oral suspension, in pediatric patients
≥ 2 years of age who weigh ≤ 40 kg.
• Treatment of invasive aspergillosis in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 13
years of age (delayed-release tablets).

Policy
• Treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis including oropharyngeal
candidiasis refractory to itraconazole and/or fluconazole, in patients ≥ 13
years of age (oral suspension).
The duration of posaconazole therapy is varied. In a pivotal study, where
posaconazole oral suspension was compared with fluconazole capsules as
prophylaxis for the prevention of invasive fungal infections in allogeneic HSCT
recipients with GVHD, the mean duration of posaconazole therapy was 80 days.1
The recommended total duration of therapy for the treatment of invasive
aspergillosis is 6 to 12 weeks. The duration of therapy for other indications varies
and is based on recovery from neutropenia, degree of immunosuppression, and
severity of underlying disease and clinical response.
Guidelines
The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for aspergillosis
(2016) recommend posaconazole for treatment and prophylaxis of invasive
aspergillosis.2 The IDSA guidelines for candidiasis (2016) and the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for the Prevention and
Treatment of Cancer-Related Infections (version 1.2025 – June 20, 2025) note
posaconazole as one of the drugs of choice for the treatment of fluconazole-
refractory oropharyngeal candidiasis.3,5 The IDSA notes posaconazole as having
high-quality evidence for prophylaxis of candidiasis.
NCCN notes posaconazole is active against Candida and Aspergillus species, some
Mucorales spp, some of the rarer molds, and against dimorphic fungi and C.
neoformans. Posaconazole is noted as a treatment option for the prevention of
fungal infections in patients with significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
[especially grade 3/4] who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy; treatment
should continue until resolution of significant GVHD. Posaconazole is also a
treatment option for these groups of patients with neutropenia: patients with
myelodysplastic syndrome, patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and patients who
are allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients; treatment should continue
until resolution of neutropenia. NCCN also notes posaconazole as a treatment
option for the treatment of the following infections: mouth and esophageal
infections (e.g., oral thrush) refractory to fluconazole; invasive fusariosis;
Scedosporium infections; and maintenance treatment of mucormycosis.5 In
addition, posaconazole is a treatment option for patients with invasive, refractory
infections who have intolerance to amphotericin B formulations.
The guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and
adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections (last updated April
2025) note posaconazole as an option for treatment of patients with
coccidioidomycosis, or histoplasmosis; and as chronic suppressive treatment of
esophageal candidiasis.4
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
The global guideline for the diagnosis and management of cryptococcosis (2024)
note posaconazole as an alternative treatment option for patients with cryptococcal
Page 2 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Antifungals – Posaconazole (Oral) Prior Authorization
Polic
meningitis.6 This is a moderate strength recommendation as posaconazole and
other triazole drugs have not been formally studied in cryptococcosis.
The global guideline for the diagnosis and management of mucormycosis (2019)
also recommends posaconazole as an alternative treatment option for
mucormycosis.7 Duration of therapy ranges from 1 week to almost 3 years, with a
mean duration of approximately 6 months.
