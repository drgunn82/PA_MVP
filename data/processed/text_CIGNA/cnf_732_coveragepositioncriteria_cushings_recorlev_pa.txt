INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Recorlev, a cortisol synthesis inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of
endogenous hypercortisolemia in adults with Cushing’s syndrome for whom
surgery is not an option or has not been curative. Recorlev was approved through
the 505(b)(2) pathway and as such relied upon existing safety and efficacy
information for ketoconazole tablets to support approval. Recorlev contains
levoketoconazole as the active ingredient. Levoketoconazole is the 2S, 4R-
enantiomer derived from racemic ketoconazole.
Cushing's syndrome refers to the general state of excessive levels of cortisol
(hypercortisolism) in the blood.2,3 Hypercortisolism can occur for reasons that are
either endogenous or exogenous in nature (e.g., Cushing’s disease, cortisol-
containing medications, adrenal gland tumor, certain cancers). Cushing’s disease
(hypercortisolism caused by pituitary adenomas) is the most common type of
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing’s syndrome. Treatment for
Page 1 of 4: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Cushing’s (Recorlev Prior Authorization Policy)
Cushing’s syndrome requires a multi-modal approach. The goals of treatment are
normalization of cortisol excess, long-term disease control, avoidance of recurrence,
and reversal of clinical features.4
Guidelines
The Endocrine Society published clinical practice guidelines (2015) for the treatment
of Cushing’s syndrome.5 Recorlev is not addressed in the guidelines. First-line
treatment involves resection of the tumor unless surgery is not possible or is unlikely
to meaningfully reduce excess glucocorticoid levels. In patients with ACTH-dependent
Cushing’s syndrome who underwent non-curative surgery or for whom surgery was
not possible, the guidelines advocate several second-line therapies (e.g., repeat
transsphenoidal surgery, radiotherapy, medical therapy, and bilateral
adrenalectomy). For Cushing’s disease, the guidelines recommend all medical
therapies as second-line options after transsphenoidal surgery: steroidogenesis
inhibitors (ketoconazole, Metopirone® [metyrapone capsules], Lysodren® [mitotane
tablets], etomidate) in patients either with or without radiotherapy/radiosurgery;
pituitary-directed medical treatments (cabergoline, Signifor® [pasireotide
subcutaneous injection]) in patients who are not surgical candidates or who have
persistent disease; and mifepristone tablets (Korlym®, generic) in patients with
diabetes or glucose intolerance who are not surgical candidates or who have
persistent disease after transsphenoidal surgery.
A 2021 guideline update does recognize Recorlev as an investigational drug for the
treatment of Cushing’s syndrome, but did not give recommendations for therapy
placement within existing medications.6
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Recorlev. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Recorlev as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Recorlev to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Recorlev® (levoketoconazole tablets - Xeris)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence

of the following (A, B, C, D, and E):

surgery has not been curative; OR
ii. Patient is awaiting surgery for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome; OR
iii. Patient is awaiting therapeutic response after radiotherapy for endogenous
Cushing’s syndrome; AND
D) Patient has tried ketoconazole tablets; AND
E) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an endocrinologist or a
physician who specializes in the treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.
