INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Vanrafia, an endothelin receptor antagonist, is indicated to reduce proteinuria in
adults with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) who are at risk of
rapid disease progression, generally a urine protein-to-creatinine ration (UPCR) ≥
1.5 g/g.1
Vanrafia was approved under accelerated approval based on reduction of
proteinuria.1 It has not been established whether Vanrafia slows kidney function
decline in patients with IgAN. Continued approval for this indication may be
contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory
clinical trial.
Disease Overview
IgAN is the most common primary glomerular disease in the world and it is the
leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure.2 The disease is
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Nephrology – Vanrafia Prior Authorization Policy
slowly progressive; approximately 25% to 30% of patients develop kidney failure
within 20 to 25 years of presentation. The management of IgAN is focused on
supportive care to slow the rate of disease progression. IgAN is characterized by a
single histopathologic criterion of predominant or co-dominant IgA deposits on
kidney biopsy; however, it is well recognized that the disease exhibits
heterogeneity in clinical and pathological features. Hypertension and proteinuria
are major risk factors for the progression of CKD. Guidelines from Kidney
Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) [2024] note that proteinuria
reduction to < 0.5 g/day, a surrogate marker of improved kidney outcomes in
IgAN, is a reasonable target.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Vanrafia was evaluated in a Phase III trial in adults with biopsy-
proven IgAN, proteinuria ≥ 1.0 g/day at screening, and estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (ALIGN, n = 270).1,3 Additionally,
patients were receiving the maximum tolerated dose of an angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for ≥ 12 weeks prior
to study entry. Patients with use of immunosuppressive medications (including
corticosteroids for > 2 weeks within 3 months of screening), chronic kidney disease
(CKD) in addition to IgAN, or IgAN secondary to other conditions were excluded.
The majority of patients remained on a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor
throughout the study.1
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in urine protein-to-
creatinine ratio (based on 24-hour urine sample) at Week 36.1,3 At Week 36, the
primary endpoint was significantly greater with Vanrafia in the interim analysis set
(comprised of the first 270 patients randomized in the study, who completed 36
weeks of the trial). The geometric least squares mean percent change in UPCR
from baseline was -38% for Vanrafia vs. -3% for placebo. This resulted in a
statistically significant relative reduction from baseline in UPCR for the Vanrafia,
corresponding to a 36% relative reduction with Vanrafia (P < 0.001). Exploratory
efficacy endpoints for changes in UPCR from baseline to Week 36 in the sodium-
glucose linked transporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitor stratum, was -39% for Vanrafia (14
patients) compared to -3% for placebo (15 patients).3
Safety
Vanrafia has a Black Box Warning for embryo-fetal toxicity.1 Vanrafia may cause
major birth defects if used during pregnancy. Effective contraception must be
started before the start of treatment and continued for 2 weeks after treatment.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Vanrafia.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the
approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Vanrafia as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, approval requires Vanrafia to be prescribed by or in consultation with a
physician who specializes in the condition being treated.

• Vanrafia™ (atrasentan tablets - Novartis)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent use with other medications indicated for the treatment of
immunoglobulin A nephropathy (e.g., Fabhalta and Filspari).
The requested medication should not be administered in combination with other
medications indicated for immunoglobulin A nephropathy. Combination therapy
is generally not recommended due to a lack of controlled clinical trial data
supporting additive efficacy.
