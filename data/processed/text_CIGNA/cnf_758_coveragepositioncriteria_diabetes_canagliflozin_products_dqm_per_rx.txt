INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Invokana, Invokamet, and Invokamet XR are products that all contain canagliflozin,
a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor.1 Invokamet and Invokamet
XR are combination products that contain canagliflozin in combination with
metformin.2 These agents are indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to
improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 10 years of age with
Type 2 diabetes mellitus.1,2
The canagliflozin component, specifically, is indicated in patients with Type 2
diabetes mellitus:
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Diabetes – Canagliflozin Products Drug Quantity
Management Policy – Per Rx
• To reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults
with established cardiovascular disease.
• To reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum
creatinine, cardiovascular death, and hospitalization for heart failure
in adults with diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria > 300 mg/day.
Limitation of Use: Invokana is not recommended for use in patients with Type 1
diabetes mellitus. It may increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in these
patients. Invokana is not recommended for use to improve glycemic control in
adults with Type 2 diabetes mellitus with an estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) less than 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Invokana is likely to be ineffective in this
setting based upon its mechanism of action.
Dosing
Invokana
The recommended dose of Invokana for glycemic control is 100 mg once daily
(QD).1 The dose may be increased to 300 mg QD if needed for additional glycemic
control. Dose reductions may be needed for patients with renal dysfunction.
Invokamet/Invokamet XR
Invokamet is dosed as one tablet twice daily (BID) and Invokamet XR is dosed as
two tablets QD, with the initial and maintenance dosing based on the patient’s renal
function and current medication regimen.2 Following initial dosing, if patients
require additional glycemic control, the dose can be titrated up, to a maximum daily
dose of canagliflozin 300 mg and metformin HCl 2,000 mg, in patients with an eGFR
of at least 60 mL/min/1.73m2. For patients with renal impairment, the maximum
recommended dose is lower. Initiation of Invokamet or Invokamet XR is not
recommended in patients with an eGFR < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2, due to the
metformin component.
Drug Interactions
If the patient is taking a canagliflozin product with a UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
(UGT) inducer (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir), the total daily
dose should be increased from 100 mg to 200 mg.1,2 If the patient has an eGFR ≥
60 mL/min/1.73 m2, the daily dose may be further increased to 300 mg, if needed
for additional glycemic control.
Availability
Invokana is available as 100 mg tablets and 300 mg tablets in bottles of 30 or 90
tablets.1
Invokamet and Invokamet XR are each available as tablets containing 50 mg/500
mg, 50 mg/1,000 mg, 150 mg/500 mg, and 150 mg/1,000 mg of
canagliflozin/metformin, respectively, supplied in bottles of 60 tablets.2 Invokamet
XR differs from Invokamet in that it provides canagliflozin for immediate-release
and metformin HCl for extended-release.
