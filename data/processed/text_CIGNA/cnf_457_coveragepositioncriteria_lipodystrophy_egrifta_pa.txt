INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Egrifta SV and Egrifta WR, analogs of human growth hormone-releasing factor, are
indicated for the reduction of excess abdominal fat in patients with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who have lipodystrophy.1,2
Limitations of use: 1) Long-term cardiovascular safety of Egrifta SV and Egrifta WR
have not been established; 2) Not indicated for weight loss management; and 3)
There are no data to support improved compliance with anti-retroviral therapies in
HIV-positive patients taking Egrifta SV or Egrifta WR.1,2 In the pivotal trial of Egrifta,
all patients had lipodystrophy and excess abdominal fat, evidenced by a waist
circumference ≥ 95 cm (≥ 94 cm for female) and a waist-to-hip ratio ≥ 0.94 (≥ 0.88
for female). Patients were required to be on a stable antiretroviral regimen for at
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Lipodystrophy – Egrifta Prior Authorization Policy
least 8 weeks. Safety and effectiveness of Egrifta SV and Egrifta WR have been
established in patients between 18 and 65 years of age.
The new formulation, Egrifts WR is still a daily injectable product, but only needs
weekly reconstitution.6 The new formulation is set to replace Egrista SV.
Disease Overview
Lipodystrophy is the change in body fat which affects some patients with HIV
infection, either due to HIV infection or due to medications to treat HIV.3
Lipodystrophy is not a concern for most people who start HIV treatment now, because
newer HIV medications are less likely to cause this effect. Egrifta increases secretion
of growth hormone and has been shown to decrease visceral adipose tissue and spare
subcutaneous adipose tissue.4
Safety
Because the long-term cardiovascular safety and potential long-term cardiovascular
benefit are not established, careful consideration should be given whether to continue
Egrifta treatment in patients who do not show a clear efficacy response, as judged
by the degree of reduction in visceral adipose tissue measured by waist circumference
or computerized tomography scan. In the pivotal studies, efficacy of Egrifta was
assessed at Week 26. Because Egrifta induces the release of endogenous growth
hormone (a known growth factor) and increases serum insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-
1), the benefits of treatment should be weighed against the increased risk of
malignancies in patients who are HIV-positive. Since the effect of prolonged IGF-1
elevations on the development or progression of malignancies is unknown, monitor
IGF-1 levels closely during Egrifta therapy and consider discontinuation in patients
with persistent elevations of IGF-1 levels (e.g., > 3 standard deviation scores),
especially if the patient has not experienced a robust response. Egrifta should be
used with caution in patients who develop glucose intolerance or diabetes;
discontinuation of therapy should be considered for patients who do not show a clear
efficacy response.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Egrifta SV
and Egrista WR. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases
where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because
of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Egrifta SV and Egrifta WR as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and
long-term efficacy, initial approval requires Egrifta SV and Egrifta WR to be prescribed
by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
In the approval indication, as appropriate, an asterisk (*) is noted next to the
specified gender. In this context, the specified gender is defined as follows:
females/males are defined as individuals with the biological traits of a woman/man,
regardless of the individual’s gender identity or gender expression.

• Egrifta WR™ (tesamorelin subcutaneous injection –

is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Lipodystrophy – Egrifta Prior Authorization Policy
1. Abdominal Obesity in a Patient without Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV) Infection. More data are needed. Egrifta has been studied in a very
limited number of patients who have abdominal obesity without HIV infection.5
To be eligible for the published trial, patients were required to have a peak
stimulated growth hormone no higher than 9 mcg/L on a standardized growth
hormone-releasing hormone-arginine stimulation test. Patients (n = 60) were
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with Egrifta 2 mg once daily or placebo.
The primary endpoint was the change in visceral adipose tissue from baseline.
Over 12 months (using last observation carried forward), visceral adipose tissue
improved significantly in patients treated with Egrifta compared with placebo (net
treatment effect vs. placebo: -35 [95% confidence interval: -58, -12]; P =
0.003). Treatment with Egrifta increased IGF-1 by 90%, decreased triglycerides
by 20%, and decreased log C-reactive protein by 24% compared with placebo.
There was no effect on total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the treatment groups.
2. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-Related Cachexia, Weight Loss, or
Fat Distribution other than Lipodystrophy. Egrifta has not been studied in
these conditions.
3. Patient > 65 Years of Age. There is no information on the use of Egrifta SV or
Egrifta WR in patients > 65 years of age with HIV and lipodystrophy.1,2
