INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Savaysa, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Non-valvular atrial fibrillation, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic
embolism.
• Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism
(PE), following 5 to 10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant.
Savaysa has a unique Boxed Warning regarding reduced efficacy in non-valvular
atrial fibrillation in patients with a creatinine clearance > 95 mL/min; Savaysa should
be avoided in these individuals.1 Safety and effectiveness of Savaysa in pediatric
patients have not been established.
Guidelines
Guidelines are available which support the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)
in their commonly used clinical settings, such as DVT/PE2-5 and atrial fibrillation.6,7
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Anticoagulants – Savaysa Prior Authorization Policy
In patients who are eligible for a DOAC, these are generally preferred over vitamin K
antagonists (e.g., warfarin). It is noted that in the randomized trials in atrial
fibrillation, DOACs were consistently at least non-inferior to warfarin regarding the
composite of stroke or systemic embolism and were associated with a lower risk of
serious bleeding.7
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
Savaysa has data for prophylaxis of VTE after hip replacement surgery.9 Although
data are not robust regarding use of DOACs in other off-label thromboembolic-related
conditions, American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines (2024) suggest
anticoagulation for certain patients (e.g., superficial vein thrombosis,).2 The choice
of anticoagulant is often individualized based on patient-specific factors; therefore,
for certain patients, DOAC use may be considered in practice. Evidence for DOACs is
limited for off-label scenarios; in general, there is more clinical experience with
agents such as vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin) and low molecular weight
heparin in these settings.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Savaysa. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days.

Note: Examples of other thromboembolic-related conditions include superficial
vein thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, hepatic vein thrombosis, or
prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in a high-risk patient.

product (e.g., enoxaparin, Fragmin [dalteparin injection]); OR
Note: A patient who has tried Eliquis (apixaban tablets), Xarelto
(rivaroxaban tablets and oral suspension), or Pradaxa (dabigatran
capsules) is not required to try warfarin, fondaparinux, or a low molecular
weight heparin.
ii. Patient has been started on Savaysa for the treatment of an acute
thromboembolic condition.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
