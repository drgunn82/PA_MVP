INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Strensiq, a tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP), is indicated for the
treatment of patients with perinatal/infantile- and juvenile-onset
hypophosphatasia (HPP).1 Strensiq is an enzyme replacement therapy which
replaces human TNSALP.
Disease Overview
HPP is an inherited metabolic disease caused by a loss-of-function pathogenic variant
in the gene which codes for TNSALP.2 TNSALP is tissue-bound and expressed in high
concentrations in the liver, kidney, neurons, neutrophils, bone, and teeth.2,3 In HPP,
inorganic pyrophosphate and pyridoxal 5’-phosphate, substrates for TNSALP, are
increased and lead to disease manifestations. Inorganic pyrophosphate is an inhibitor
of bone mineralization, and its accumulation leads to rickets and osteomalacia.
Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate, a derivative of vitamin B , is necessary for the synthesis of
6
gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, for pyridoxal 5’-phosphate to enter the

Authorization Policy
neuron, it must be dephosphorylated to allow pyridoxal to enter the neuron where it
is rephosphorylated. The decreased synthesis of GABA in HPP leads to seizures.
HPP is a rare disease, with an estimated live-birth incidence, for the severe forms of
HPP, of 1:100,000 in Canada and approximately 1:300,000 in Europe.2,4 Prevalence
in certain populations, such as Canadian Mennonites, may be as high as 1:2,500
births. Disease severity can range from neonatal death with almost no skeletal
mineralization to dental problems in adults without any bone symptoms.2-4 In
patients most severely affected by HPP, mortality ranges from 50% to nearly 100%
during infancy.2
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Strensiq. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Strensiq as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Strensiq to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Strensiq® (asfotase alfa subcutaneous injection – Alexion)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Hypophosphatasia – Perinatal/Infantile- and Juvenile-Onset. Approve for
1 year if the patient meets ALL of the following (A, B, C, and D):

i. Molecular genetic testing documenting pathogenic tissue non-specific
alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) gene variants; OR
ii. Low baseline serum alkaline phosphatase activity; OR
iii. An elevated level of a tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase substrate
(i.e., serum pyridoxal 5’-phosphate, serum or urinary inorganic
pyrophosphate, urinary phosphoethanolamine); AND
B) Patient meets ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Patient currently has, or had a history of, clinical manifestations consistent
with hypophosphatasia; OR
Note: Examples of clinical manifestations include skeletal abnormalities,
premature tooth loss, muscle weakness, poor feeding, failure to thrive,
respiratory problems, vitamin B -dependent seizures.
6
ii. Patient has a family history (parent or sibling) of hypophosphatasia without
current clinical manifestations of hypophosphatasia; AND
C) Disease onset < 18 years of age; AND
