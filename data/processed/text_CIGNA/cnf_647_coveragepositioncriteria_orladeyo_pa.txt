I NSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT
PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN
CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Orladeyo, an inhibitor of plasma kallikrein, is indicated for prophylaxis to prevent
attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients ≥ 12 years of age.1
Guidelines
According to US HAE Association Medical Advisory Board Guidelines (2020), when
HAE is suspected based on clinical presentation, appropriate testing includes
measurement of the serum C4 level, C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) antigenic level,
and C1-INH functional level.2 Low C4 plus low C1-INH antigenic or functional level is
consistent with a diagnosis of HAE types I/II. The decision on when to use long-term
prophylaxis cannot be made on rigid criteria but should reflect the needs of the
individual patient. First-line medications for HAE I/II include intravenous C1-INH,
Haegarda® (C1-INH [human] subcutaneous injection), or Takhzyro® (lanadelumab-
flyo subcutaneous injection). The guideline was written prior to approval of Orladeyo.
According to World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical
Immunology guidelines (2021), it is recommended to evaluate for long-term
prophylaxis at every visit, taking disease activity, burden, and control as well as
patient preference into consideration.3 The following therapies are supported as first-
line options for long-term prophylaxis: plasma-derived C1-INH (87% agreement),
Takhzyro (89% agreement), and Orladeyo (81% agreement). With regard to
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hereditary Angioedema ( Orladeyo Prior Authorization
Policy
plasma-derived C1-INH, it is noted that Haegarda provided very good and dose-
dependent preventative effects on the occurrence of HAE attacks; the subcutaneous
route may provide more convenient administration and maintains improved steady-
state plasma concentrations compared with the intravenous route. Of note,
androgens are not recommended in the first-line setting for long-term prophylaxis.
Recommendations are not made regarding long-term prophylaxis in HAE with normal
C1-INH levels.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Orladeyo.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with Orladeyo, approval requires Orladeyo to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated. A patient
who has previously met initial therapy criteria for Orladeyo for the requested indication
under the Coverage Review Department and is currently receiving the requested
therapy is only required to meet the continuation therapy criteria (i.e., currently
receiving Orladeyo). If past criteria have not been met under the Coverage Review
Department and the patient is currently receiving Orladeyo, initial therapy criteria
must be met. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
Documentation: Documentation will be required where noted in the criteria as
[documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not limited to, chart
notes, laboratory records, and prescription claims records.
• Orladeyo® (berotralstat capsules – Biocryst)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Due to C1 Inhibitor (C1-INH) Deficiency –
Prophylaxis. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets one of the following (A or
B):
A) Initial therapy. Approve if the patient meets all of the following (i, ii, and iii):
i. Patient is ≥ 12 years of age; AND
ii. Patient has HAE type I or type II as confirmed by the following diagnostic
criteria (a and b):
Note: A diagnosis of HAE with normal C1-INH (also referred to as HAE type
III) does NOT satisfy this requirement.
a) Patient has low levels of functional C1-INH protein (< 50% of normal)
at baseline, as defined by the laboratory reference values
[documentation required]; AND
b) Patient has lower than normal serum C4 levels at baseline, as defined
by the laboratory reference values [documentation required]; AND

Policy
iii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an
allergist/immunologist or a physician who specializes in the treatment of
HAE or related disorders.
B) Patient is currently receiving Orladeyo. Approve if the patient meets all of the
following (i, ii, iii, and iv):
Note: If the patient is currently receiving the requested therapy but has not
previously received approval of Orladeyo for this indication through the
Coverage Review Department, review under criteria for Initial Therapy.
i. Patient is ≥ 12 years of age; AND
ii. Patient has a diagnosis of HAE type I or type II [documentation
required]; AND
Note: A diagnosis of HAE with normal C1-INH (also referred to as HAE type
III) does NOT satisfy this requirement.
iii. According to the prescriber, the patient has had a favorable clinical
response since initiating Orladeyo prophylactic therapy compared with
baseline (i.e., prior to initiating prophylactic therapy); AND
Note: Examples of favorable clinical response include decrease in HAE
acute attack frequency, decrease in HAE attack severity, or decrease in
duration of HAE attacks.
iv. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an
allergist/immunologist or a physician who specializes in the treatment of
HAE or related disorders.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Orladeyo® (berotralstat capsules – Biocryst)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concomitant Use with Other Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) Prophylactic
Therapies. Note: Examples of other HAE prophylactic therapies include Cinryze
(C1 esterase inhibitor [human] intravenous infusion), Haegarda (C1 esterase
inhibitor [human] subcutaneous injection), and Takhzyro (lanadelumab-flyo
subcutaneous injection).
Orladeyo has not been studied in combination with other prophylactic therapies
for HAE, and combination therapy for long-term prophylactic use is not
recommended. Patients may use other medications, including Cinryze, for on-
demand treatment of acute HAE attacks, and for short-term (procedural)
prophylaxis.
