INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Besremi, an interferon alfa-2b, is indicated for treatment of polycythemia vera in
adults.1
Guidelines
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for myeloproliferative
neoplasms (version 2.2025 – July 8, 2025) discuss therapies for polycythemia vera.2
In low-risk patients, management of cardiovascular risk factors, low-dose aspirin (81
to 100 mg/day), and phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit < 45% are recommended
(category 2A for all). Besremi or participation in a clinical trial are listed as “preferred”
regimens for symptomatic low-risk polycythemia vera (category 2A). In high-risk
patients, “preferred” regimens for cytoreductive therapy include hydroxyurea or
Besremi (category 2A for both). Besremi is listed as “other recommended regimen”

Policy
if the patient has an inadequate response or loss of response to first-line therapy, if
not previously used.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Besremi. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Besremi as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Besremi to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Besremi® (ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft subcutaneous injection –
PharmaEssentia)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Polycythemia Vera. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets BOTH of the
following (A and B):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an oncologist.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Besremi® (ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft subcutaneous injection –
PharmaEssentia)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concomitant Use with Other Interferon Products. Besremi was not studied
in combination with other interferon products; concomitant use would be expected
to result in increased toxicity.
Note: An example of an interferon product is Pegasys® (peginterferon alfa-2a
subcutaneous injection).
2. Hepatitis B Virus. Besremi is not indicated for hepatitis B.1 Pegylated interferons
are recommended in American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases
(AASLD) guidelines for chronic hepatitis B (updated 2018).3 Phase I/II data
suggest similar efficacy between Besremi and Pegasys for chronic hepatitis B;
however, further data are needed.4

3. Hepatitis C Virus. Besremi is not indicated for hepatitis C.1 Pegasys, another
pegylated interferon, is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.
However, peginterferons are no longer addressed by the AASLD recommendations
for testing, managing, and treating HCV (updated October 24, 2022).5
