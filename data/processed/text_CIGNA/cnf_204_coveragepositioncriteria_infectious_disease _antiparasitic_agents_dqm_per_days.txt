hours, and then 4 tablets BID (morning and evening) for the following 2 days (total
course of 24 tablets).
For patients who are unable to swallow the tablets such as infants and children, the
tablets may be crushed and mixed with a small amount of water (1 to 2 teaspoons)
in a clean container for administration immediately prior to use.7 In the event of
vomiting within 1 to 2 hours after administration, a repeat dose should be taken. If
the repeat dose is vomited, the patient should be given an alternative antimalarial
for treatment.
Emverm chewable tablets
The recommended dose for pinworm is 1 tablet one time.4 For whipworm,
roundworm, and hookworm, the recommended dose is 1 tablet BID (morning and
evening) for 3 consecutive days. If the patient is not cured 3 weeks after
treatment, a second course of treatment is advised.

Atovaquone/proguanil tablets (Malarone, generic)
For the prevention of malaria, prophylactic therapy is started 1 or 2 days before
entering a malaria endemic area and continued daily during the stay, and for 7 days
after the return.9 In adults, the dose is 1 tablet (250 mg/100 mg) per day. For
pediatric patients, the dose is based on body weight (Table 8).

Management Policy – Per Rx and Per Days
Mefloquine tablets
For the treatment of malaria in adults, the recommended dose is 1,250 mg (5
tablets) as a single dose.10 For the treatment of malaria in pediatric patients, the
recommended dose is 20 to 25 mg/kg. The pediatric dose should not exceed the
adult dose. Experience with mefloquine in pediatric patients weighing < 20 kg is
limited. If a full-treatment course with mefloquine does not lead to improvement
within 48 to 72 hours, mefloquine should not be used for retreatment. An
alternative therapy should be used. Similarly, if previous prophylaxis with
mefloquine has failed, mefloquine should not be used for curative treatment.
In pediatric patients, if a significant loss of drug product is observed or suspected
because of vomiting, a second full dose of mefloquine should be administered to
patients who vomit less than 30 minutes after receiving the drug.10 If vomiting
occurs 30 to 60 minutes after a dose, an additional half-dose should be given. If
vomiting recurs, the patient should be monitored closely and alternative malaria
treatment considered if improvement is not observed within a reasonable period of
time.
For the prophylaxis of malaria in adults, the recommended dose is 250 mg (1
tablet) once weekly (QW).10 In pediatric patients, the recommended dose for the
prophylaxis of malaria is 5 mg/kg QW. In pediatric patients weighing > 45 kg, the
dose is one 250 mg tablet QW, in pediatric patients weighing 30 to 45 kg the dose
is three-quarters of a tablet QW, and in pediatric patients weighing 20 to 30 kg, the
dose is one-half tablet QW. Per product labeling, prophylaxis should begin 1 week
before arrival in an endemic area. In certain cases, such as when a traveler is
taking other medication, it may be desirable to start prophylaxis 2 to 3 weeks prior
to departure, in order to ensure that the combination of drugs is well tolerated.
The CDC cites prophylaxis should begin ≥ 2 weeks prior to arrival and may be
started as early as 4 weeks prior to arrival to allow potential adverse events to
occur before travel.24 Subsequent weekly doses should be taken regularly, always
on the same day of each week.10 To reduce the risk of malaria after leaving an
endemic area, prophylaxis must be continued for 4 additional weeks. When
prophylaxis with mefloquine fails, physicians should carefully evaluate which
antimalarial to use for therapy.
Primaquine phosphate tablets
The FDA-approved dose for the radical cure of malaria is 1 tablet (26.3 mg) daily
(QD) for 14 days.11 The CDC recommends primaquine for prophylaxis for short
duration travel (duration not defined) to areas with principally P. vivax; the
recommended dose is 52.6 mg daily (2 tablets) in adults and 0.8 mg/kg (not to
exceed 52.6 mg) in pediatric patients started 1 to 2 days prior to travel, daily while
in the malaria endemic area, and daily for 7 days after return from travel.
Quinine sulfate capsules (Qualaquin, generic)
For treatment of uncomplicated malaria in adults, the recommended dose is 648
mg (2 capsules) every 8 hours (Q8H) for 7 days.12 In patients with severe chronic
renal impairment, the recommended dose is a loading dose of 648 mg (2 capsules)

Management Policy – Per Rx and Per Days
followed 12 hours later by maintenance doses of 324 mg (1 capsule) Q12H for 7
days.
Ivermectin tablets (Stromectol, generic)
The recommended dose of Stromectol for the treatment of strongyloidiasis is a
single oral dose designed to provide approximately 200 mcg/kg (Table 10).3 The
CDC also cites a two-dose regimen (200 mcg/kg/day for 2 days).25

The recommended dose for the treatment of onchocerciasis is a single oral dose
designed to provide approximately 150 mcg/kg of body weight (Table 11).3 In
mass distribution campaigns in international treatment programs, the most
commonly used dose interval is 12 months. For the treatment of individual
patients, retreatment may be considered at intervals as short as 3 months.

In addition to its FDA-approved indications, CDC guidelines support the use of
ivermectin in the following settings:
• For the treatment of Trichuriasis caused by Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), at a
dose of 200 mcg/kg/day for 3 days.26
• For the treatment of pediculosis, as a single dose of 200 mcg/kg or 400
mcg/kg.27 The dose may be repeated in 9 to 10 days.
• For classic scabies, two doses of oral ivermectin (200 mcg/kg/dose) taken 1
week apart are recommended.28 For crusted scabies, ivermectin 200
mcg/kg/dose should be taken in three doses (Days 1, 2, and 8), five doses
(Days 1, 2, 8, 9, and 15), or seven doses (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 22, and 29).
• For the treatment of hyperinfection syndrome or disseminated strongyloidiasis,
at a dose of 200 mcg/kg/day until stool and/or sputum exams are negative for 2
weeks.25
Tinidazole tablets
The recommended dose for trichomoniasis is 2 g as a single dose.6 For the
treatment of giardiasis in adults, the dose is 2 g as a single dose; in pediatric
patients, the dose is 50 mg/kg (up to 2 g) as a single dose. For the treatment of
intestinal amebiasis, the recommended dose in adults is a 2 g/day for 3 days. In
17 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Infectious Disease – Antiparasitics Drug Quantity
Management Policy – Per Rx and Per Days
pediatric patients the recommended dose is 50 mg/kg/day (up to 2 g/day) for 3
days. For the treatment of amebic liver abscess, the recommended dose in adults
is a 2 g/day for 3 to 5 days. In pediatric patients the recommended dose is 50
mg/kg/day (up to 2 g/day) for 3 to 5 days. There are limited pediatric data on
durations of therapy exceeding 3 days, although a small number of children were
treated for 5 days. For the treatment of bacterial vaginosis, the recommended
dose in non-pregnant females is a 2 g/day for 2 days or a 1 g/day for 5 days. For
those unable to swallow tablets, tinidazole tablets may be crushed in artificial
cherry syrup; four 500 mg tablets can be pulverized and mixed with 10 mL of syrup
(final volume of 30 mL).
