INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Zilbrysq, a complement C5 inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of generalized
myasthenia gravis in adults who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-
positive.1
Disease Overview
Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease that causes
weakness in the skeletal muscles, which are responsible for breathing and moving
parts of the body, including the arms and legs.2 The hallmark of myasthenia gravis
is muscle weakness that worsens after periods of activity and improves after
periods of rest. Certain muscles such as those that control eye and eyelid
movement, facial expression, chewing, talking, and swallowing are often involved in
the disorder; however, the muscles that control breathing and neck and limb
movements may also be affected. Acquired myasthenia gravis results from the

Policy
binding of autoantibodies to components of the neuromuscular junction, most
commonly the acetylcholine receptor.3
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Zilbrysq was evaluated in 12-week, multicenter, randomized,
double-blind placebo-controlled study (n = 174).1,4 All of the enrolled patients had
anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive generalized myasthenia gravis. In
addition, patients had a Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical
classification class II to IV and a Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-
ADL) total score of ≥ 6. MG-ADL assesses the impact of generalized myasthenia
gravis on daily functions of eight signs or symptoms that are typically impacted by
this disease. Each sign or symptom is assessed on a 4-point scale; a higher score
indicates greater impairment. At baseline, 85% of patients in each group received
cholinesterase inhibitors, 63% received steroids, and 51% received non-steroidal
immunosuppressive therapies, at stable doses. Patients were randomized to receive
either Zilbrysq 0.3 mg/kg or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint was a
comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the MG-ADL
total score at Week 12. Statistically significantly greater improvement in the MG-
ADL total score was observed in the Zilbrysq group compared with placebo: -4.39
points vs. -2.30 points, respectively (P < 0.001). Statistically significant
improvement in the secondary efficacy endpoints were also observed in the Zilbrysq
group vs. placebo.
Guidelines
An international consensus guidance for the management of myasthenia gravis was
published in 2016.3 The guidelines recommend pyridostigmine for the initial
treatment in most patients with myasthenia gravis. The ability to discontinue
pyridostigmine can indicate that the patient has met treatment goals and may
guide the tapering of other therapies. Corticosteroids or immunosuppressant
therapy should be used in all patients with myasthenia gravis who have not met
treatment goals after an adequate trial of pyridostigmine. Nonsteroidal
immunosuppressant agents used in treatment of myasthenia gravis include
azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and tacrolimus. It
is usually necessary to maintain some immunosuppression for many years,
sometimes for life. Plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin can be used
as short-term treatments in certain patients. A 2020 update to these guidelines
provides new/additional recommendations for methotrexate, rituximab, and
eculizumab intravenous infusion (Soliris®, biosimilars).5 All recommendations
should be considered extensions or additions to recommendations made in the
initial international consensus guidance (2016). Oral methotrexate may be
considered as a steroid-sparing agent in patients with generalized myasthenia
gravis who have not tolerated or responded to steroid-sparing agents. Rituximab
should be considered as an early therapeutic option in patients with anti-muscle-
specific tyrosine kinase antibody-positive myasthenia gravis who have an
unsatisfactory response to initial immunotherapy. Eculizumab should be considered
in the treatment of severe, refractory, anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive
MG.

POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Zilbrysq. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Zilbrysq as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Zilbrysq to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated.
• Zilbrysq® (zilucoplan subcutaneous injection – UCB)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
