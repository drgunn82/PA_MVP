INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Spevigo, an interleukin-36 receptor antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of
generalized pustular psoriasis flares in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 12 years
of age and weighing ≥ 40 kg.1
Spevigo subcutaneous is used for treatment of generalized pustular psoriasis when a
patient is not experiencing a flare. The recommended dosage of Spevigo
subcutaneous for the treatment of generalized pustular psoriasis when not
experiencing a flare in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age and ≥ 40 kg
is a loading dose of 600 mg (four 150 mg injections) followed by 300 mg (two 150
mg injections) administered subcutaneously 4 weeks after the loading dose
injection(s) and every 4 weeks thereafter.

Guidelines
The National Psoriasis Foundation has written a consensus statement for generalized
pustular psoriasis (2024). The statement strongly advocates for timely access to FDA
approved therapy for generalized pustular psoriasis because delays can increased the
risk of mortality in patients.2 The statement states that Spevigo is the first FDA-
approved treatment that is highly effective in the treatment of generalized pustular
psoriasis flares in adults. Timely access to approved therapies is critical to reducing
morbidity and mortality in patients presenting with generalized pustular psoriasis.
Treatment guidelines from the Medical Board of the National Psoriasis Foundation
(2012) address the management of generalized pustular psoriasis in different clinical
scenarios.3 Recommended therapies include acitretin, cyclosporine, methotrexate,
and infliximab for adults with generalized pustular psoriasis as first-line therapy.
Second-line therapy includes Humira, Enbrel, topical therapy (e.g., corticosteroids,
calcipotriene, and tacrolimus), and PUVA (psoralen and ultraviolet A). There are also
separate recommendations for pediatric and pregnant patients.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Spevigo.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients
treated with Spevigo, initial approval requires Spevigo to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
• Spevigo® (spesolimab-sbzo subcutaneous injection - Boehringer
Ingelheim)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Generalized Pustular Psoriasis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient
meets ONE of the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets ALL of the following
(i, ii, iii, iv, v, and vi):
i. Patient is ≥ 12 years of age; AND
ii. Patient weighs ≥ 40 kilograms (kg); AND
iii. Patient has history of at least two generalized pustular psoriasis flares of
moderate-to-severe intensity in the past; AND
iv. Patient has a Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Physician Global Assessment
(GPPGA) total score of 0 or 1; AND
v. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):
a) Patient meets BOTH of the following ([1] and [2]):
(1) Patient has had a 4-month trial of least one treatment for
generalized pustular psoriasis; AND

Authorization Policy
Note: Examples of treatment include methotrexate, acitretin,
cyclosporine, or biologics.
(2) Patient has had a history of flaring while on treatment or with
dose reduction or discontinuation of treatment; OR
b) Patient has tried at least one treatment for generalized pustular
psoriasis but was unable to tolerate a 4-month trial; AND
vi. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a dermatologist; OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Spevigo Subcutaneous. Approve for 1 year if the
patient meets BOTH of the following (i and ii):
i. Patient has been established on therapy for at least 6 months; AND
Note: A patient who has received < 6 months of therapy or who is
restarting therapy should be considered under criterion A (Initial Therapy).
ii. Patient has experienced a beneficial clinical response, defined as
improvement from baseline (prior to initiating the requested drug) in at
least one of the following: reduction of generalized pustular psoriasis flares
or an improvement in Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Physician Global
Assessment (GPPGA) score.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Spevigo® (spesolimab-sbzo subcutaneous injection - Boehringer
Ingelheim)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concomitant use with Another Biologic or Disease-Modifying
Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARD) Prescribed for Treatment of Generalized
Pustular Psoriasis. Although not approved, there are case reports documenting
use of some biologics approved for plaque psoriasis (see Appendix for examples)
for treatment of generalized pustular psoriasis. In the pivotal study for Spevigo,
patients were required to discontinue therapy for generalized pustular psoriasis
prior to receiving Spevigo.
Note: Patients with concomitant plaque psoriasis and generalized pustular
psoriasis may be receiving a biologic for treatment of plaque psoriasis.
2. Plaque Psoriasis. Spevigo has not been studied in patients with plaque psoriasis
without generalized pustular psoriasis.
Note: Patients with concomitant plaque psoriasis and generalized pustular
psoriasis may be reviewed under the generalized pustular psoriasis criteria above.
