INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE

DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Voxzogo, a C type natriuretic peptide (CNP) analog, is indicated to increase linear growth
in pediatric patients with achondroplasia with open epiphyses.1
Disease Overview
Achondroplasia is the most common form of disproportionate short stature in humans.2 It is
a primary skeletal dysplasia caused by a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3
(FGFR3) gene; this mutation leads to impaired endochondral ossification. Achondroplasia
occurs in approximately 1 in 20,000 to 30,000 live births.3 It occurs as a result of a
spontaneous mutation in 80% of patients (i.e., both parents are of normal height).4 In the
remaining 20% of patients, the mutation is inherited from a parent. Achondroplasia is
characterized by short stature, long-bone shortening in the proximal upper and lower
extremities, and macrocephaly. The diagnosis can be confirmed by molecular testing.5 In
the pivotal trial for Voxzogo, achondroplasia was confirmed by genetic testing in all
patients.2 Additionally, exclusion criteria included evidence of decreased growth velocity (<
1.5 cm/year) or of growth plate closure through bilateral lower extremity X-rays.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Voxzogo. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Voxzogo as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires Voxzogo

to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
• Voxzogo™ (vosoritide subcutaneous injection (BioMarin)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for
FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Achondroplasia. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ONE of the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy or Patient Has Been on Voxzogo for < 1 Year. Approve if the patient
meets ALL of the following (i, ii, iii, iv, v, and vi):
i. Patient is < 18 years of age; AND
ii. The diagnosis of achondroplasia has been confirmed by genetic testing with an
identifiable mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 (FGFR3) gene;
AND
iii. Patient’s epiphyses are open; AND
iv. Patient will not have limb-lengthening surgery during treatment with Voxzogo; AND
v. The prescriber has confirmed the patient is able to drink approximately 240 to 300
mL of fluid in the hour prior to Voxzogo administration; AND
vi. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist.
B) Patient Has Been Receiving Voxzogo for ≥ 1 Year. Approve if the patient meets ALL of
the following (i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, and vii):
i. Patient is < 18 years of age; AND
ii. The diagnosis of achondroplasia has been confirmed by genetic testing with an
identifiable mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 (FGFR3) gene;
AND
iii. Patient’s epiphyses are open; AND
iv. Patient will not have limb-lengthening surgery during treatment with Voxzogo;
AND
v. The prescriber has confirmed the patient is able to drink approximately 240 to 300
mL of fluid in the hour prior to Voxzogo administration; AND
vi. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist;
AND
vii. Patient’s most recent annualized growth velocity continues to be above their
baseline annualized growth velocity value (i.e., before the patient started on
Voxzogo).
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Voxzogo™ (vosoritide subcutaneous injection (BioMarin)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for ANY other use(s)
including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated
as new published data are available):
1. Hypochondroplasia, Thanatophoric Dysplasia, or other Short Stature Conditions
other than Achondroplasia (e.g., Trisomy 21, Pseudoachondroplasia). Voxzogo is
only indicated for patients with achondroplasia.1 There is a small, published Phase 2 trial
showing some efficacy for children with hypochondroplasia.11 There is no evidence
Voxzogo is effective for other short stature conditions.

2. Concurrent Treatment with Growth Hormone (e.g., somatropin), Long-Acting
Growth Hormone (e.g., Ngenla® [somatrogon-ghla], Skytrofa®
[lonapegsomatropin], Sogroya® [somapacitan-beco]), or Insulin-like Growth
Factor- 1 (IGF-1) [i.e., Increlex® {mecasermin}] Agents. Growth hormone agents
and Increlex are NOT indicated to increase growth in patients with achondroplasia.6-10
Additionally, there are no available studies demonstrating the safety or efficacy of
concurrent use with Voxzogo.
