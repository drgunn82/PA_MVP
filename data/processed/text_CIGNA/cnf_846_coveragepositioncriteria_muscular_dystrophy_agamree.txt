INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Agamree, a corticosteroid, is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular
Dystrophy (DMD) in patients ≥ 2 years of age.1
Disease Overview
DMD is a rare, progressive X-linked disease resulting from mutation(s) of the DMD
gene, also known as the Dystrophin gene.2,3 Due to the mutation(s), the dystrophin
protein, which is key for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells, is not
produced or very minimally produced. Since this is an X-linked mutation, DMD almost
exclusively impacts young males. DMD is a progressive muscle-weakening disease
that affects skeletal, respiratory, and cardiac muscles. It is usually diagnosed in the
second or third year of life. Due to progressive decline, most patients die of cardiac
or respiratory complications in the third or fourth decade of life. The incidence of DMD
in the US is approximately 1 in 5,000 live male births.
Guidelines
Agamree is not addressed in guidelines. Guidelines from the DMD Care
Considerations Working Group (2018) state that glucocorticoids and physical therapy
are the mainstays of treatment for DMD.2-6 Both therapies should be continued after
the patient loses ambulation. Guidelines for the use of corticosteroids in DMD are

Policy
available from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) [2016, reaffirmed January
2022].4 The AAN notes that in patients with DMD, prednisone should be used to
improve strength and pulmonary function (moderate evidence). Emflaza™
(deflazacort tablets and oral suspension) and prednisone may be used to improve
timed motor function, reduce the need for scoliosis surgery, and delay the onset of
cardiomyopathy until the patient is 18 years of age (weak evidence). Emflaza may
also be used to improve pulmonary function and to delay the age at loss of ambulation
by 1.4 to 2.5 years (weak evidence). There is insufficient evidence to support or
refute the benefit of prednisone on survival (insufficient evidence). Emflaza may be
used to increase survival at 5 and 15 years of follow-up (weak evidence).
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Agamree. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Agamree as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Agamree to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
Documentation: Documentation is required for use of Agamree as noted in the
criteria as [documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not
limited to, chart notes, prescription claims records, prescription receipts, and/or other
information.
