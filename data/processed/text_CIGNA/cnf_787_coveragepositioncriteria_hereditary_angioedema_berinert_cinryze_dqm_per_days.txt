INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Berinert and Cinryze are human plasma-derived C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH)
replacement therapies indicated for the following uses:1,2
• Berinert is indicated for the treatment of acute abdominal, facial, or
laryngeal hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks in adults and pediatric
patients.1
• Cinryze is indicated for routine prophylaxis against HAE attacks in
patients ≥ 6 years of age.2
Of note, although Cinryze is labeled for use in the prophylactic setting and Berinert
is labeled for use in the acute treatment setting, use of Cinryze in the acute setting
and Berinert in the prophylactic setting has been reported in literature.3,4
Dosing
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hereditary Angioedema – Berinert and Cinryze Drug
Quantity Management Policy – Per Days
Potencies of Berinert and Cinryze are both expressed in standard units of C1-INH
(equal to the mean C1-INH quantity in 1 mL of normal human plasma).1,2 For
prophylaxis, the maximum allowable dose in the policy comes from the Cinryze
prescribing information and is applied to both Berinert and Cinryze prophylactic use
requests. For a patient ≥ 12 years of age, the recommended dose is 1,000 units by
intravenous (IV) route, once every 3 or 4 days.2 If a patient does not respond
adequately, doses up to 2,500 units (not to exceed 100 units/kg) once every 3 or 4
days may be considered based on individual patient response. For a patient < 12
years of age, a dose of 500 units IV once every 3 or 4 days is recommended; the
dose may be adjusted up to 1,000 units once every 3 or 4 days. For acute
treatment, dosing recommendations come from the Berinert prescribing
information and are applied to both Berinert and Cinryze requests for acute use.
The recommended dose is 20 units/kg for treatment of an acute HAE attack.1
Availability
Both Berinert and Cinryze are supplied in single-use vials containing 500 units per
vial.1,2 The Berinert vials are packaged as a part of a kit which also includes 10 mL
Sterile Water for Injection, a 10 mL silicone-free syringe, an IV set and butterfly
needle, a Mix2Vial filter transfer set, and alcohol swabs.1 Cinryze, in a 500 unit
single-use vial, is supplied both with and without a 5 mL vial of Sterile Water for
Injection.2
The quantity limits provided in this policy provide sufficient quantity for a long-term
prophylaxis dose of 1,000 units twice weekly plus treatment of four HAE attacks (20
units/kg per attack) for a patient weighing up to 100 kg. If the patient requires
additional quantity based on higher long-term prophylactic dosing, greater body
weight, or treatment of an additional HAE attack in a 28-day interval (refer to Table
1 for dosing requirements in these scenarios), exceptions will be provided in
Criteria.

Guidelines
US HAE Medical Advisory Board guidelines (2020) recommend that all patients with
laboratory confirmed HAE should have access to at least two standard doses of an
approved on-demand medication for treatment of acute attacks.5 On-demand
treatment of attacks is most effective when administered early after attack onset.
Short-term prophylaxis may be indicated before invasive medical, surgical, or
dental procedures. A single dose of 20 units/kg of plasma-derived C1-INH can be
given 1 to 12 hours before the stressor.
POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to promote the safe,
effective, and economic use of Berinert and Cinryze. If the Drug Quantity
Management rule is not met for the requested medication at the point of service,
coverage will be determined by the Criteria below. All approvals are provided for 1
year in duration. “One-time” approvals are provided for 30 days in duration.
