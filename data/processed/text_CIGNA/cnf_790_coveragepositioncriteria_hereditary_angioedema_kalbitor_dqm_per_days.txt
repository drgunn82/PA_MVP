THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING
CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR
BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN
DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE
STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT
MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A
CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A
CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE
BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE
APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT
COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH
COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT
AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE
ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE
USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY
AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Kalbitor, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of acute
attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in patients ≥ 12 years of age.1
Potentially serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have occurred
in patients treated with Kalbitor.1 Kalbitor should only be administered by a
healthcare professional with appropriate medical support to manage anaphylaxis
and HAE.
Dosing
The recommended dose of Kalbitor is 30 mg (3 mL) administered subcutaneously
(SC) in three 10 mg injections.1 If the attack persists, an additional dose of 30 mg
SC may be administered within a 24-hour period.
Availability
Kalbitor is supplied as three 10 mg/mL single-use vials packaged in a carton.1 Each
vial contains 10 mg of ecallantide.

Guidelines
US HAE Medical Advisory Board guidelines (2020) recommend that all patients with
laboratory confirmed HAE should have access to at least two standard doses of an
approved on-demand medication for treatment of acute attacks.2 On-demand
treatment of attacks is most effective when administered early after attack onset.
POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to promote the safe,
effective, and economic use of Kalbitor. If the Drug Quantity Management rule is
not met for the requested medication at the point of service, coverage will be
determined by the Criteria below. All approvals are provided for the duration noted
below. “One-time” approvals are provided for 30 days in duration.
