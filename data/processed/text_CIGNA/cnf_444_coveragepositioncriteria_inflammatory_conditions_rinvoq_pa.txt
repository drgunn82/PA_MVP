CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Rinvoq, a Janus kinase inhibitor (JAKi), is indicated for the following uses:1
• Ankylosing spondylitis, for treatment of active disease in adults who have
had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis
factor inhibitors (TNFis).
• Atopic dermatitis, for treatment of refractory, moderate to severe atopic
dermatitis in patients ≥ 12 years of age, whose disease is not adequately
controlled with other systemic drug products (including biologics) or when
those therapies are not advisable.
• Crohn’s disease, for treatment of moderately to severely active disease in
adults who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more
TNFis.
• Giant cell arteritis, in adults.
Page 1 of 15 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Rinvoq/Rinvoq LQ Prior
Authorization Policy
• Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, in adults with objective signs
of inflammation who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one
or more TNFis.
• Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in patients ≥ 2 years of
age with active disease who have had an inadequate response or intolerance
to one or more TNFis.
• Psoriatic arthritis, for treatment of active disease in patients > 2 years of
age who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more
TNFis.
• Rheumatoid arthritis, for treatment of moderately to severely active
disease in adults who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one
or more TNFis.
• Ulcerative colitis, for treatment of moderately to severely active disease in
adults who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more
TNFis.
Rinvoq LQ oral solution is only indicated for use in polyarticular JIA and psoriatic
arthritis in patients 2 to < 18 years of age.1 Rinvoq LQ oral solution is not
substitutable with Rinvoq extended-release tablets.
For all indications, Rinvoq/Rinvoq LQ is not recommended for use in combination
with other JAKis, biologics, or potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or
cyclosporine.1
Guidelines
Guidelines are available for treatment of inflammatory conditions:
• Ankylosing Spondylitis and Non-Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis:
Current guidelines do not address Rinvoq. Guidelines from the American
College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of
America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (2019)
recommend a TNFi as the initial biologic.2 In those who are secondary non-
responders to a TNFi, a second TNFi is recommended over switching out of
the class. Both TNFis and interleukin (IL)-17 blockers are recommended over
Xeljanz®/Xeljanz® XR (tofacitinib tablets/tofacitinib extended release tablets).
• Atopic Dermatitis: Guidelines for the care and management of atopic
dermatitis from the American Academy of Dermatology (2023) and the
American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (2023) have been
updated to address Rinvoq.3,4 Systemic therapies are recommended in
patients with moderate to severe or widespread disease, in those with
impaired quality of life, and those whose atopic dermatitis is refractory to
topical therapies. Biologic agents, such as Dupixent® (dupilumab
subcutaneous injection) or Adbry® (tralokinumab-ldrm subcutaneous
injection), are recommended as initial systemic treatment due to their
favorable efficacy and safety profiles compared to traditional systemic
therapies (e.g., azathioprine, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate
mofetil). Rinvoq may be considered in adults refractory or intolerant to
Dupixent or Adbry.
Page 2 of 15 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Rinvoq/Rinvoq LQ Prior
Authorization Policy
• Crohn’s Disease: Current guidelines do not address Rinvoq. The American
College of Gastroenterology (ACG) has guidelines for Crohn’s disease
(2018).5 TNFis are listed as an option for disease that is resistant to
corticosteroids, severely active disease, perianal fistulizing disease, and
maintenance of remission. In post-operative Crohn’s disease, a TNFi should
be started within 4 weeks of surgery to prevent recurrence. Guidelines from
the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [2021] include TNFis
among the therapies for moderate to severe Crohn’s disease, for induction
and maintenance of remission.6
• Giant Cell Arteritis: Current guidelines do not address Rinvoq. The
ACR/Vasculitis Foundation (2021) conditionally recommend initiating
treatment with high dose corticosteroids.12 Once inflammation is controlled,
the corticosteroid dose is gradually reduced with the goal of establishing a
maintenance dose that controls disease activity while minimizing adverse
effects. Glucocorticoid-sparing agents, such as tocilizumab or
methotrexate, may be added to the treatment regimen to reduce the amount
of corticosteroids needed.
• JIA: Rinvoq is not addressed in ACR/Arthritis Foundation guidelines for the
treatment of JIA (2019) specific to juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis,
sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.11 TNFis are the biologics recommended for
polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Actemra® (tocilizumab intravenous
infusion, tocilizumab subcutaneous injection) and Orencia® (abatacept
intravenous infusion, abatacept subcutaneous injection) are also among the
biologics recommended for polyarthritis. Biologics are recommended
following other therapies (e.g., following synthetic disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs] for active polyarthritis or following a
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for active JIA with sacroiliitis or
enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic
may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g., if there is
involvement of high-risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high
disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint
damage).
• Psoriatic Arthritis: Current guidelines do not address Rinvoq. Guidelines
from ACR (2018) recommend TNFis over other biologics and Xeljanz for use
in treatment-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis and in those who were
previously treated with an oral therapy.7
• Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of
a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum
tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.8
• Ulcerative colitis: The AGA (2024)9 and ACG (2019)10 have clinical practice
guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in
adults. AGA recognizes all of the FDA-approved advanced therapies as
potential options for adults with moderate to severe UC.9 Advanced
therapies include the biologics and targeted synthetic small molecule drugs.
In general, the AGA recommends starting with advanced therapies and/or
immunomodulators. Immunomodulators are recommended in the setting of
maintenance of clinical remission induced by corticosteroids. The ACG
recommends TNF inhibitors, Entyvio® (vedolizumab IV infusion/subcutaneous
Page 3 of 15 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Rinvoq/Rinvoq LQ Prior
Authorization Policy
injection), Stelara® (ustekinumab IV infusion/subcutaneous injection), or
Xeljanz®/Xeljanz® XR (tofacitinib tablets, tofacitinib extended-release tablets)
for induction treatment of moderate to severe disease.10 The guidelines also
recommend that any drug that effectively treats induction should be
continued for maintenance.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of
Rinvoq/Rinvoq LQ. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases
where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because
of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated
with Rinvoq/Rinvoq LQ as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and
long-term efficacy, initial approval requires Rinvoq/Rinvoq LQ to be prescribed by or
in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.

3. Concurrent Use with Other Potent Immunosuppressants (e.g.,
azathioprine, cyclosporine).1 Co-administration with other potent
immunosuppressive drugs has the risk of added immunosuppression and has not
been evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis. Note: This does NOT exclude use of
Rinvoq with methotrexate. In rheumatoid arthritis, Rinvoq has been evaluated
with background methotrexate and other conventional synthetic disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
