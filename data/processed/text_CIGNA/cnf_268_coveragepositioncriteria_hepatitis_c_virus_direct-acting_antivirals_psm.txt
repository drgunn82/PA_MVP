INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.

OVERVIEW
Page 1 of 12 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hepatitis C Virus Direct-Acting Antivirals Preferred
Specialty Management Policy for National Preferred Formulary and Basic Formulary
The standard of care for all Hepatitis C genotypes is all-oral therapy with direct-
acting antivirals. For more information on criteria within a Prior Authorization
program by specific condition, refer to the respective standard Hepatitis C Prior
Authorization Policy.
All of the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are indicated for the treatment of chronic
hepatitis C virus (HCV). Mavyret is the only agent indicated for acute HCV.6
Epclusa is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1 through 6 in patients ≥ 3
years of age with or without compensated cirrhosis, or with decompensated
cirrhosis in combination with ribavirin.4 Harvoni is indicated for the treatment of
patients ≥ 3 years of age: 1) with genotypes 1, 4, 5, and 6 chronic HCV with or
without compensated cirrhosis; 2) with genotype 1 chronic HCV with
decompensated cirrhosis; and 3) with genotype 1 or 4 infection in liver transplant
recipients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, in combination with
ribavirin.1 Mavyret is indicated for the treatment of patients ≥ 3 years of age with
acute or chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection with or without
compensated cirrhosis and for the treatment of patients ≥ 3 years of age with HCV
genotype 1 infection who have previously been treated with a regimen containing
an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor, but not both.6 Mavyret is
additionally indicated in kidney and liver transplant patients with specific dosing for
these patient populations. Sovaldi is indicated for the treatment of adults with
genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 chronic HCV in combination with ribavirin or pegylated
interferon + ribavirin.2 Sovaldi is also indicated in pediatric patients ≥ 3 years of
age with genotypes 2 or 3 chronic HCV in combination with ribavirin. Vosevi is
indicated for the treatment of adults with chronic HCV infection with or without
compensated cirrhosis in the following types of patients: Patients with genotype 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection who have previously been treated with an HCV regimen
containing an NS5A inhibitor; and for patients with genotype 1a or 3 infection and
who have previously been treated with an HCV regimen containing Sovaldi without
an NS5A inhibitor.5 Zepatier is indicated for the treatment of patients ≥ 12 years
(or ≥ 30 kg) with genotypes 1 and 4 chronic HCV.3
Epclusa and Harvoni are the products indicated in decompensated liver disease.
