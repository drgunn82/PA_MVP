REVIEW DATE: 12/04/2024; selected revision 07/23/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Velsipity, a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, is indicated for the
treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC), in adults with moderately to severely active
disease.1
Guidelines/Clinical Efficacy
The AGA (2024) and the ACG (2025) have clinical practice guidelines on the
management of moderate to severe UC.2,3 In moderate to severe disease, systemic
corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be utilized for induction of remission.
Advanced therapies recommended include TNF inhibitors, Entyvio® (vedolizumab),
interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)
receptor modulators, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. If steroids are utilized for
induction, efforts should be made to introduce steroid-sparing agents for
maintenance therapy. Of note, guidelines state corticosteroids may be avoided

Velsipity Prior Authorization Policy
entirely when other effective induction strategies are planned.3 Both guidelines also
recommend that any drug that effectively treats induction should be continued for
maintenance.2,3
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Velsipity. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Velsipity as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Velsipity to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Velsipity® (etrasimod tablets – Pfizer)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Ulcerative Colitis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of
the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets BOTH of the
following (i and ii):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist;
OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Velsipity. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
BOTH of the following (i and ii):
i. Patient has been established on therapy for at least 6 months; AND
Note: A patient who has received < 6 months of therapy or who is
restarting therapy is reviewed under criterion A (Initial Therapy).
ii. Patient meets at least ONE of the following (a or b):
a) When assessed by at least one objective measure, patient experienced
a beneficial clinical response from baseline (prior to initiating the
requested drug); OR
Note: Examples of assessment for inflammatory response include fecal
markers (e.g., fecal calprotectin), serum markers (e.g., C-reactive
protein), endoscopic assessment, and/or reduced dose of
corticosteroids.
b) Compared with baseline (prior to initiating Velsipity), patient
experienced an improvement in at least one symptom, such as
decreased pain, fatigue, stool frequency, and/or decreased rectal
bleeding.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Velsipity® (etrasimod tablets – Pfizer)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
2. Concurrent Use with Other Potent Immunosuppressants. In pivotal trials,
patients who received Velsipity were not to receive concomitant treatment with
non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive or immune-modulating therapies used for
the treatment of ulcerative colitis. Combination therapy is generally not
recommended due to a potential for a higher rate of adverse effects with
combinations and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.1
Note: Examples include 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and
methotrexate.
