INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ivabradine, a hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel blocker, is
indicated for the following uses:1
• Heart failure, in adults, to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening of
the disease in those with stable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with left
ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, who are in sinus rhythm with a
resting heart rate ≥ 70 beats per minute (bpm) and either are receiving
maximally tolerated doses of beta blockers or have a contraindication to beta
blocker use.
• Heart failure, in pediatric patients ≥ 6 months and older, for treatment
of stable symptomatic disease due to dilated cardiomyopathy, among those
who are in sinus rhythm with an elevated heart rate.
Page 1 of 5: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Cardiology - Ivabradine Prior
Authorization Policy
Data are available with ivabradine that note improvement in symptoms and increased
exercise performance in patients with inappropriate sinus tachycardia, defined as a
sinus heart rate > 100 bpm at rest (with a mean 24-hour heart rate > 90 bpm not
due to primary causes) which is generally associated with distressing symptoms such
as palpitations, weakness, dizziness, and syncope.2-9 Beta blockers have also been
used for this condition. Limited data are available for other treatments that have
been used and/or effectiveness have not been established (e.g., beta blockers,
fludrocortisone, volume expansion, clonidine, and erythropoietin).
Guidelines
A few guidelines have recommendations that involve ivabradine.
• Heart Failure: The American Heart Association/American College of
Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America published guidelines in 2022 for
the management of heart failure.10 For patients with symptomatic (New York
Heart Association Class II to III) stable chronic heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction (LVEF ≤ 35%) who are receiving guideline-directed medical
therapy, including a beta blocker at maximum tolerated dose, and who are in
sinus rhythm with a heart rate of ≥ 70 bpm at rest, ivabradine can be beneficial
to reduce heart failure hospitalizations and cardiovascular death.
• Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia: The 2015 Heart Rhythm Society Expert
Consensus Statement on the diagnosis and treatment of postural orthostatic
tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and vasovagal
syncope state that ivabradine can be useful for treating patients with
inappropriate sinus tachycardia.2 Additionally, the 2015 American College of
Cardiology, American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice
Guidelines, and the Heart Rhythm Society also state that ivabradine is
reasonable for ongoing management in patients with symptomatic
inappropriate sinus tachycardia (class IIa recommendation).3 Beta blockers
may be considered for ongoing management in patients with symptomatic
inappropriate sinus tachycardia (class IIb recommendation). Also, the
guidelines state that the combination of beta blockers and ivabradine may be
considered for the ongoing management of patients with inappropriate sinus
tachycardia (class IIb recommendation).
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of ivabradine.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with ivabradine as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires ivabradine to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Corlanor® (ivabradine tablets and oral solution - Amgen, generic
[tablets only])
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):

1. Heart Failure. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of the following (A,
B, C, D, and E):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND

treatment; OR
Note: Examples of beta blockers are metoprolol succinate sustained-
release, carvedilol, bisoprolol, and Coreg CR (carvedilol extended-release
capsules).
ii. Patient has a contraindication to use of beta blocker therapy; AND
Note: Examples of contraindications to the use of beta blockers are
bronchospastic disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
asthma, severe hypotension or bradycardia.
E) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a cardiologist.
2. Heart Failure due to Dilated Cardiomyopathy in Pediatric Patients.

Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
3. Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
BOTH of the following (A and B):
A) Patient meets ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Patient has tried or is currently receiving one beta blocker for inappropriate
sinus tachycardia; OR
Note: Examples of beta blockers are metoprolol and bisoprolol.
ii. Patient has a contraindication to use of beta blocker therapy; AND
Note: Examples of contraindications to the use of beta blockers are
bronchospastic disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
asthma, severe hypotension or bradycardia.
B) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a cardiologist.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Corlanor® (ivabradine tablets and oral solution - Amgen, generic
[tablets only])
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Stable Angina Pectoris, in Patients Without Chronic Heart Failure.
Ivabradine has been studied as a treatment for stable angina pectoris but further
data are needed.11-13 The 2023 American Heart Association/American College of
Cardiology guidelines for chronic coronary disease (CCD) state that in patients
with CCD and normal left ventricular function, the addition of ivabradine to
standard anti-anginal therapy is potentially harmful.14
