CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ofev, a kinase inhibitor, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), treatment.
• Interstitial lung diseases, chronic fibrosing with a progressive
phenotype, treatment.
• Interstitial lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis, to slow the
rate of decline in pulmonary function.
The safety and effectiveness of Ofev in pediatric patients have not been established.1
Disease Overview
IPF is a form of chronic interstitial lung pneumonia associated with histologic pattern
of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).2 The condition is specific for patients that have
clinical features and the histologic pattern of UIP or a classical high-resolution

Ofev Prior Authorization Policy
computed tomography (HRCT) scan for IPF. In this lung condition there is cellular
proliferation, interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, or the combination of these findings,
within the alveolar wall that is not due to infection or cancer.3 IPF is rather rare and
the prevalence in the US ranges from 10 to 60 cases per 100,000. However, in one
study, the prevalence was 494 cases per 100,000 in 2011 in adults > 65 years of
age, which is higher than previous information. The disease mainly impacts older
adults.2 Symptoms include a progressive dry cough and exertional dyspnea. Patients
experience a high disease burden with hospital admissions. The clinical course varies
among patients but the mean survival after symptom onset is usually 3 to 5 years.
The cause is unknown but environmental and occupational hazards may play a role,
as well as a history of smoking. Medical therapy is only modestly effective and mainly
shows the rate of disease progression. Agents FDA-approved for IPF are Ofev and
Esbriet® (pirfenidone capsules and film-coated tablets). Lung transplantation is a
therapeutic option.
Interstitial lung disease is a common manifestation of systemic sclerosis and is a
leading cause of death.4-6 Among patients who have systemic sclerosis, up to one-
half of patients may have interstitial lung disease.7 The estimate prevalence and
annual incidence of systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease is 1.7 to
4.2 and 0.1 to 0.4 per 100,000 individuals, respectively.7 However, it is notable that
systemic sclerosis is a connective disease that it not limited to the lungs but impacts
the skin, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and musculoskeletal
system. The condition displays great heterogeneity and can be challenging to treat.4
When the disease affects the internal organs, significant morbidity and mortality may
result. Mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine are
immunosuppressants that are utilized in the treatment of interstitial lung disease
associated with systemic sclerosis. Corticosteroids are also used. Besides Ofev,
Actemra® (tocilizumab subcutaneous injection) is also indicated for use in patients
with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease.
Clinical Efficacy
Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
The clinical efficacy of Ofev if patients with IPF was established in one Phase II study
and two Phase III studies that were identical in design (n = 1,231).1,8,9 The trials
were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies comparing treatment with
Ofev 150 mg twice daily with placebo for 52 weeks. In the two Phase III studies,
patients were ≥ 40 years of age and had a forced vital capacity (FVC) ≥ 50% of the
predicted value. The diagnosis was confirmed by HRCT and, if available, surgical lung
biopsy specimens were assessed. For all three studies, a statistically significant
reduction in the annual rate of decline of FVC was observed in patients receiving Ofev
compared with patients receiving placebo. Also, data shows that the proportion of
patients that demonstrated categorical declines in lung function was lower for
patients given Ofev compared with placebo. Acute IPF exacerbations were also
reduced. Some information suggests that patients who have FVC < 50% of predicted
may also have some benefits from therapy.10-13

Interstitial Lung Diseases, Chronic Fibrosing with a Progressive Phenotype
The efficacy of Ofev was assessed in patients ≥ 18 years of age with chronic fibrosis
interstitial lung diseases with a progressive phenotype in a Phase III, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial (INBUILD) [n = 663].1,14,15 Patients received Ofev 150 mg
BID or placebo for at least 52 weeks and the main endpoint was the annual rate in
decline in FVC over 52 weeks. Patients who had a clinical diagnosis of chronic fibrosing
interstitial lung disease were involved in the trial if they had relevant fibrosis (greater
than 10% fibrotic features) and had clinical signs of progression (e.g., FVC decline ≥
10%, recent FVC decline ≥ 5% but < 10% with worsening symptoms or imaging, or
worsening symptoms and worsening imaging). Patients were required to have an FVC
≥ 45% of predicted and a diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide of at
least 30% and < 80% of predicted.
Interstitial Lung Disease Associated with Systemic Sclerosis
The efficacy of Ofev was established in SENSCIS, a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled Phase III trial in patients ≥ 18 years of age with systemic
sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease (n = 576).1,5 Patients were randomized to
Ofev or placebo for at least 52 weeks and up to 100 weeks. Patients had ≥ 10%
fibrosis on a chest HRCT scan conducted within the previous 12 months and had an
FVC ≥ 40% of predicted. The primary efficacy endpoint was the annual rate of decline
in FVC over 52 weeks. The annual rate of decline of FVC over 52 weeks was
significantly reduced by 41 mL in patients receiving Ofev vs. placebo (-52 mL for Ofev
vs. -93 mL with placebo).
Guidelines
In 2015, the clinical practice guideline from the American Thoracic Society (ATS),
European Respiratory Society (ERS), the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS), and
Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) on the treatment of IPF were updated.16
Regarding Ofev, the guideline suggests use of this medication (conditional
recommendation, moderate confidence in estimates of effect). The guideline notes
that the data with Ofev focuses on patients with IPF who have mild to moderate
impairment in pulmonary function tests. It is not known if the benefits would differ
among patients with more severe impairment in pulmonary function testing or in
patients who have other comorbidities.16 Updated recommendations by this group in
2022 support use of Ofev in patients with IPF.17 Regarding the treatment of
progressive pulmonary fibrosis, Ofev is a suggested treatment in patients who have
failed standard management for fibrotic interstitial lung disease (e.g.,
immunosuppressive treatment) other than IPF.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Ofev. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Ofev, approval requires
Ofev to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.

1. Ofev is Being Used Concomitantly with Esbriet (pirfenidone capsules).
Esbriet is another medication indicated for IPF. The effectiveness and safety of
concomitant use of Ofev with Esbriet have not been established. The 2015
ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline regarding the treatment of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update of the 2011 clinical practice guideline)
does not recommend taking Ofev and Esbriet in combination.16 A small
exploratory study was done in which patients with IPF receiving Ofev added on to
Esbriet.18 Further research is needed to determine the utility of this combination
regimen.
