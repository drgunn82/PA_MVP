INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS

BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ebglyss, an interleukin (IL)-13 antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 12
years of age who weigh ≥ 40 kg whose disease is not adequately controlled with
topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable.1 Ebglyss
may be used with or without topical corticosteroids (TCSs).
Clinical Efficacy
Three pivotal studies of Ebglyss enrolled patients ≥ 12 years of age with moderate
to severe chronic atopic dermatitis affecting ≥ 10% of their body surface area.1-4
Patients also had a history of an inadequate response to a sufficient course of
topical therapy (e.g., topical corticosteroids). At Week 16, Ebglyss was found to be
more effective in achieving a clinical response compared with placebo. In the
monotherapy trials, the majority of patients who achieved a clinical response to
Ebglyss at Week 16 experienced sustained efficacy at Week 52.

Guidelines
Current atopic dermatitis guidelines do not make recommendations regarding
Ebglyss. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) Guidelines for the Care
and Management of Atopic Dermatitis in Adults (topical therapies update in 2022
and systemic agents update in 2023) and the American Academy of Allergy,
Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI)/American College of Allergy, Asthma
and Immunology (ACAAI) Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters Atopic
Dermatitis Guidelines (2023) continue to affirm that despite the availability of
newer, systemic therapies, topical agents remain the mainstay of treatment due to
their proven track record and favorable safety profiles.5-7 Several topical agents are
recommended, with topical corticosteroids commonly used first-line for mild to
severe atopic dermatitis in all skin regions. If topical therapy and basic
management (e.g., moisturizers, bathing modifications) have been optimized and
the patient has not achieved adequate control, systemic therapy may be
considered.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Ebglyss. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Ebglyss as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Ebglyss to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Ebglyss® (lebrikizumab-lbkz subcutaneous injection – Eli Lilly)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Atopic Dermatitis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of
the following conditions (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 4 months if the patient meets ALL of the
following criteria (i, ii, iii, and iv):
i. Patient meets ONE of the following criteria (a or b):
a) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; OR
b) Patient meets BOTH of the following criteria (1 and 2):
1) Patient is 12 to 17 years of age; AND
2) Patient weighs ≥ 40 kg; AND
ii. Patient has atopic dermatitis involvement estimated to be ≥ 10% of the
body surface area according to the prescriber; AND
iii. Patient meets ALL of the following criteria (a, b, and c):
Page 2 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Immunologicals – Ebglyss Prior Authorization Policy
a) Patient has tried at least one medium-, medium-high, high-, and/or
super-high-potency prescription topical corticosteroid; AND
b) This topical corticosteroid was applied daily for at least 28 consecutive
days; AND
c) Inadequate efficacy was demonstrated with this topical corticosteroid
therapy, according to the prescriber; AND
iv. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an allergist,
immunologist, or dermatologist; OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Ebglyss. Approve for 1 year if the patient
meets BOTH of the following criteria (i and ii):
i. Patient has already received at least 4 months of therapy with Ebglyss;
AND
Note: A patient who has received < 4 months of therapy or who is
restarting therapy with Ebglyss should be considered under criterion 1A
(Atopic Dermatitis, Initial Therapy).
ii. Patient has responded to therapy as determined by the prescriber.
Note: Examples of a response to Ebglyss therapy are marked
improvements in erythema, induration/papulation/edema, excoriations,
and lichenification; reduced pruritus; decreased requirement for other
topical or systemic therapies; reduced body surface area affected with
atopic dermatitis; or other responses observed.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Ebglyss® (lebrikizumab-lbkz subcutaneous injection – Eli Lilly)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Asthma. Ebglyss is not indicated for the treatment of asthma.1 Several studies,
including one Phase III study, evaluated Ebglyss for the treatment of adults with
asthma with mixed results.8-11 Two replicate Phase IIb studies (designed as
Phase III, but host-cell impurity in the study drug material was discovered),
LUTE and VERSE (published) [n = 463] evaluated Ebglyss in patients with
uncontrolled asthma despite treatment with medium- to high-dose inhaled
corticosteroids and a second asthma controller.10 Following a mean 24 weeks of
treatment, Ebglyss significantly reduced asthma exacerbations vs. placebo in
patients with in patients who had baseline periostin levels > 50 ng/mL.
However, in the Phase III study, STRETTO (published) [n = 310], Ebglyss did
not significantly improve forced expiratory volume in 1 second compared with
placebo in patients with mild to moderate asthma.11 In the Phase III LAVOLTA I
and II trials, Ebglyss was evaluated in adults with uncontrolled asthma despite
standard therapy.17 Ebglyss significantly reduced exacerbation rates in
biomarker-high patients (elevated periostin or eosinophils) in LAVOLTA I, but
the results were not consistently replicated in LAVOLTA II.

2. Concurrent use of Ebglyss with another Monoclonal Antibody Therapy
(i.e., Adbry, Dupixent, Cinqair, Fasenra, Nemluvio, Nucala, Tezspire, or
Xolair). The efficacy and safety of Ebglyss in combination with other
monoclonal antibodies have not been established.
3. Concurrent Use of Ebglyss with Janus Kinase Inhibitors (JAKis) [oral or
topical]. Use of JAK inhibitors is not recommended for use in combination with
other JAK inhibitors, biologic immunomodulators (e.g., Ebglyss), or with other
immunosuppressants.12-15
Note: Examples of JAK inhibitors are Cibinqo® (abrocitinib tablets), Leqselvi™
(deuruxolitinib tablets), Rinvoq®/Rinvoq® LQ (upadacitinib tablets and oral
solution), and Opzelura® (ruxolitinib cream).
4. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. Ebglyss is not indicated for the treatment of
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.1 In one Phase II, randomized, placebo-controlled
study (published) [n = 505], Ebglyss was not found to provide a benefit in
forced vital capacity decline vs. placebo when either administered as
monotherapy or in combination with pirfenidone.16
