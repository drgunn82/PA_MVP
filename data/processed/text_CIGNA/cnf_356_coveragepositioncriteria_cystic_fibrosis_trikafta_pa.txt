CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Trikafta is a combination of ivacaftor, a cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
(CFTR) potentiator, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor. It is indicated for the treatment of
cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients ≥ 2 years of age who:
• Have at least one F508del mutation in the CFTR gene; OR
• Have a mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to Trikafta based on in vitro
data.1
If the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be
used to confirm the presence of at least one indicated mutation. Table 1 lists
responsive CFTR mutations based on clinical response, and/or in vitro data in Fischer

CFTR – Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator.
Guidelines
The most current treatment recommendations are the Standards of Care for CFTR
variant-specific therapy for people with CF, from the European Cystic Fibrosis Society
(2023).2 However, the Standards do not reflect the currently approved age
indications for Kalydeco® (ivacaftor tablets and oral granules) [≥ 1 months of age],
Orkambi® [lumacaftor/ivacaftor tablets and oral granules] (≥ 1 year of age), or
Trikafta (≥ 2 years of age). In general, Trikafta is recommended over other agents
where indications overlap. The Standards recommend Trikafta in patients ≥ 6 years
of age with CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for F508del. In patients with
one or more responsive non-F508del variant, Kalydeco, Symdeko®
(tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor tablets), or Trikafta are recommended. Kalydeco
is recommended in patients ≥ 4 months of age with eligible CFTR gene variants.
Orkambi is recommended for patients 2 to 5 years of age who are homozygous for
F508del. Of note, the Standards state that after diagnosis, repeat sweat testing
provides evidence of treatment effect on CFTR activity, but does not predict clinical
response. The European Cystic Fibrosis Society Standards for establishing and
maintaining health (2024) note that people with CF with eligible CFTR gene variants
should be offered CFTR modulator therapy.5
According to the CF Foundation (2017), CF is diagnosed when an individual has both
a clinical presentation of CF and evidence of CFTR dysfunction.3,4 Clinical presentation
of CF includes a positive newborn screening, signs and/or symptoms of CF, and/or
family history of CF. To establish a diagnosis of CF, sweat chloride tests should be
considered first, then CFTR genetic analysis (CFTR genotype), and then CFTR
physiologic tests (nasal potential difference [NPD] or intestinal current measurement
[ICM]). However, tests of CFTR function are not always done in this order. All
individuals diagnosed with CF should have a sweat chloride test and CFTR genetic
analysis performed.
In a patient with a sweat chloride test ≥ 60 mmol/L, CF diagnosis is established and
in patients with a sweat chloride test < 30 mmol/L, a diagnosis of CF is unlikely.3,4
Rarely, patients with a sweat chloride < 30 mmol/L may be considered to have CF if
alternatives are excluded and other confirmatory tests (genetic and physiologic
testing) support CF. In patients with a sweat chloride test of ≥ 30 to < 60 mmol/L,
CFTR genetic analysis is undertaken. If the genetic analysis identifies two CF-causing
CFTR mutations, CF is diagnosed, if no CFTR mutations are identified, a diagnosis of
CF is unlikely. In patients with a CFTR genotype that is undefined or of varying
clinical consequence, full gene CFTR sequencing (if not already performed) or CFTR
physiologic testing is performed (NPD or ICM). If only one CFTR variant is identified
on limited analysis, full gene CFTR sequencing should be performed. CF is possible if
both alleles possess CF-causing, undefined, or mutation of varying clinical
consequence mutations; CF is unlikely if only no CF-causing mutations are found. If
Page 3 of 7: Cigna National Formulary Coverage – Policy (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator –
Trikafta Prior Authorization Policy)
results of the NPD or ICM show CFTR dysfunction, CF is diagnosed; when testing is
unavailable or equivocal, the diagnosis of CF is not resolved, and when results of the
physiologic testing show CFTR function is preserved, a diagnosis of CF is considered
unlikely. It is recommended that patients with challenging diagnoses be evaluated at
an accredited CF Foundation Care Center.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Trikafta. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Trikafta as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Trikafta to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets; ivacaftor tablets, co
packaged and elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor oral granules; ivacaftor
