DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Nocdurna, a vasopressin analog, is indicated for the treatment of nocturia due to
nocturnal polyuria in adults who awaken at least two times per night to void.1 Before
initiating therapy, it is recommended that the diagnosis of nocturnal polyuria has been
confirmed with a 24-hour urine collection.
Disease Overview
Nocturnal polyuria is defined as nocturnal urine volume exceeding 33% of the total 24-hour
urine volume in patients ≥ 65 years of age or exceeding 20% of 24-hour urine volume in
younger patients.2 Nocturnal polyuria may improve via lifestyle and behavior modifications,
which should be implemented prior to pharmacotherapy.3 Such modifications include
minimizing fluid intake before bed (particularly caffeine and alcohol), restriction of total fluid
consumption, emptying the bladder before bed, increasing exercise and fitness levels,
earlier dosing of medications such as diuretics, and elevating the legs above heart level for
a few hours before going to bed (for patients with peripheral edema).
Safety
Nocdurna has a Boxed Warning regarding hyponatremia.1 Use of Nocdurna is
contraindicated in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia such as patients with
excessive fluid intake, illness that may cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, and in patients
using loop diuretics or systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids. It is recommended to check

Policy
serum sodium concentrations prior to initiating or resuming Nocdurna and throughout
treatment. If hyponatremia occurs, Nocdurna may need to be temporarily or permanently
discontinued. Nocdurna is contraindicated in patients with hyponatremia or among those
with a history of hyponatremia.1 Also, patients with polydipsia should not use Nocdurna. Do
not administer Nocdurna concomitantly with loop diuretics or with systemic or inhaled
glucocorticoids. Patients with renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate
< 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 should not use Nocdurna. Those with known or suspected syndrome
of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion should not use Nocdurna. Do not utilize
Nocdurna during illnesses that may cause fluid or electrolyte imbalance, such as
gastroenteritis, salt-wasting nephropathies, or systemic infection. Nocdurna is
contraindicated in patients with heart failure or among those with uncontrolled hypertension
because the fluid retention in these conditions increases the risk of worsening the
underlying condition. Also, Nocdurna is not recommended in patients at risk for increased
intracranial pressure or those with a history of urinary retention. Trials involving Nocdurna
have not included pediatric patients.
Guidelines
A consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of nocturia was published by the
International Continence Society in 2019.2 There was consensus that fluid restriction should
be advised for all desmopressin-treated patients. Newer desmopressin formulations,
including Nocdurna and Noctiva® (desmopressin acetate nasal spray), are generally
regarded as low-dose desmopressin products. Low-dose formulations are appropriate in the
absence of contraindications to desmopressin therapy.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Nocdurna. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Due to the specialized skills required for
evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Nocdurna, as well as the monitoring
required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires Nocdurna to be
prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
