CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Arikayce is indicated for the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)
lung disease, in adults who have limited or no alternative treatment options, as part
of a combination antibacterial regimen in patients who do not achieve negative
sputum cultures after at least 6 consecutive months of a background multidrug
regimen (MDR) therapy.1 As only limited clinical safety and efficacy data are
available, reserve Arikayce for adults with limited or no other treatment options.
This indication was approved under accelerated approval based on achieving sputum
culture conversion (defined as three consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures)
by Month 6.1
Limitation of Use: Arikayce has only been studied in patients with refractory MAC
lung disease defined as not achieving culture negativity after at least 6 months of
background MDR treatment.1 Arikayce is not recommended in patients with non-
refractory MAC lung disease.
Efficacy
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Antibiotics (Inhaled) – Arikayce Prior Authorization Policy
The efficacy of Arikayce was established in one open-label, randomized (2:1), multi-
center trial in patients with refractory MAC lung disease as confirmed by at least 2
sputum culture results (n = 336).7 Patients were considered to have refractory MAC
lung disease if they did not achieve negative sputum cultures after a minimum
duration of 6 consecutive months of background regimen therapy that was either
ongoing or stopped ≤ 12 months before the screening visit. The surrogate efficacy
endpoint was based on achieving culture conversion (3 consecutive monthly negative
sputum cultures) by Month 6. Patients who achieved culture conversion by Month 6
were continued on Arikayce plus background multidrug regimen or background
multidrug regimen alone based on their randomization for a total of 12 months after
the first negative sputum culture. At baseline, 329 patients were on a multidrug
background regimen that included a macrolide (93.3%), a rifamycin (86.3%), or
ethambutol (81.4%). The proportion of patients achieving culture conversion by
Month 6 was significantly greater with Arikayce plus background multidrug regimen
vs. background multidrug regimen alone (29% vs. 8.9%, respectively; P < 0.0001).
Among patients who achieved culture conversion by Month 6, 55.4% of patients in
the Arikayce group vs. no patients in the background multidrug regimen only group
had sustained and durable conversion (P = 0.0017).8 Relapse rates through 3
months after treatment were 9.2% in the Arikayce group vs. 30.0% in the
background therapy only group.
Guidelines
The American Thoracic Society, the European Respiratory Society, the European
Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease, and the Infectious Disease
Society of America developed clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of
nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) pulmonary disease (2020).2 Treatment
recommendations for MAC lung disease are based on disease severity and previous
therapies received and almost all are three drug regimens. Typical regimens involve
azithromycin or clarithromycin; ethambutol; and rifampin. For select patients, a two-
drug regimen consisting of azithromycin or clarithromycin plus ethambutol daily is
acceptable. Liposomal amikacin is not recommended for the initial treatment of MAC
pulmonary disease. The guidelines recommend the addition of liposomal amikacin to
guideline-based therapy in patients with MAC pulmonary disease who have failed
treatment (failure to convert sputum culture) after ≥ 6 months of treatment with
guideline-based therapy. Patients should be treated for ≥12 months after culture
conversion. The breakpoint for resistance to amikacin is ≥ 64 mcg/mL for parenteral
amikacin and ≥ 128 mcg/mL for amikacin liposome inhalation suspension, and finding
these MICs would lead to cessation of therapy. In patients with MAC pulmonary
disease, guidelines suggest susceptibility-based treatment for macrolides and
amikacin over empiric therapy (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in
estimates of effect).
The US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (2016
version) developed consensus recommendations on the treatment of NTM lung
disease in which nebulized amikacin is listed as a treatment option for MAC and M.
abscessus lung disease in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients.3 The guidelines recommend
that inhaled amikacin be used in conjunction with other NTM antibiotics.

Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
The efficacy of Arikayce in the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in
patients with CF has been assessed in three studies.4 In a Phase III, randomized,
open-label, non-inferiority study, patients with CF were randomized to Arikayce 590
mg once daily (QD) or tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) 300 mg twice daily (n =
302). Patients received three cycles of treatment which consisted of 28 days on
treatment followed by 28 days off treatment. The primary endpoint of the study was
the relative change from baseline to the end of the 24-week study in forced expiratory
volume in 1 second (FEV ). FEV improvement at Day 168 with Arikayce was non-
1 1
inferior to TIS (mean difference -1.31%). More patients receiving Arikayce
experienced pulmonary exacerbations compared with TIS; however, fewer patients
required all-cause hospitalization. Change in CF Questionnaire Revised was similar
between groups at the end of each treatment course. Mean reductions in P.
aeruginosa log CFU was similar for Arikayce and TIS at Day 28 and at Day 140.
10
A pooled report included 24 patients with CF and chronic P. aeruginosa infection from
two Phase Ib/IIa pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies.5 Patients received
liposomal amikacin 500 mg QD by inhalation for 14 days. Statistically significant
changes from baseline to Days 7 and 14 were seen in FEV , FEV % predicted, and
1 1
forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity. Another report
included pooled data from two dose-ranging studies (one Phase Ib/IIa and one Phase
IIa) in patients with CF (n = 105) chronically infected with P. aeruginosa.6 Patients
received 70-, 140-, 280- or 560-mg of liposomal amikacin or placebo QD for 28 days
and were followed for an additional 28 days. In repeated-measures mixed-effect
models, the 560 mg dose was associated with statistically significant improvements
in FEV , and FEV % predicted and a reduction in log CFUs.

POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Arikayce. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval
duration is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
Arikayce as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, initial approval requires Arikayce to be prescribed by or in consultation with
a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.

Revision Date
Annual Mycobacterium avium Complex Lung Disease: The criterion 10/25/2023
Revision requiring the patient to have a Mycobacterium avium complex
isolate susceptible to amikacin with a minimum inhibitor
concentration (MIC) of ≤ 64 mcg/mL was modified to remove the
requirement for the MIC value < 64 mcg/mL. The criterion now
requires that the patient has a Mycobacterium avium complex
isolate susceptible to amikacin, according to the laboratory report.
Annual Mycobacterium avium Complex Lung Disease: A note was 10/23/2024
Revision added to the criterion that the patient has a positive sputum culture
for Mycobacterium avium complex to clarify that any positive
sputum culture taken after the patient has completed > 6
consecutive months of a background multidrug regimen fulfills this
criterion.. Criteria that required the sputum culture was collected
within the past 3 months AND was collected AFTER the patient had
completed ≥ 6 consecutive months of a background multidrug
regimen, was removed.
