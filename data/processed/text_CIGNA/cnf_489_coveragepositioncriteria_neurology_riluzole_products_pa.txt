INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
All of the available riluzole products are indicated for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS).1-3
Guidelines
The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameter on the care of patients with
ALS (last updated 2009; reaffirmed 2023) states that riluzole should be offered to patients
with ALS (Level A recommendation), as it is safe and effective for modestly slowing disease
progression.4,5 Based on available clinical trial data, the AAN estimates riluzole prolongs
survival by 2 to 3 months. However, some large cohort studies estimate survival to be
prolonged for up to 21 months. The European Federation of Neurological Societies
guidelines on the clinical management of ALS (2012) also recommend patients be offered
treatment with riluzole as early as possible after diagnosis.6 While it is noted that riluzole
may be less effective in patients with late-stage disease, it is unclear when or if treatment
should be discontinued. The European Academy of Neurology in collaboration with
European Reference Network for Neuromuscular Diseases (2024) state that riluzole should
be offered lifelong to all ALS patients at diagnosis. If adverse events are noted, consider
reducing the dose and reevaluate. If adverse events still persist, consider stopping riluzole.

The recommended dosage is 50 mg twice daily.7,8 The Canadian best practice
recommendations for the management of ALS state that riluzole has demonstrated efficacy
in improving survival in ALS and there is evidence that riluzole prolongs survival by a
median duration of 3 months.9 Riluzole should be started soon after the diagnosis of ALS.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of riluzole. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with riluzole as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires riluzole to
be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
