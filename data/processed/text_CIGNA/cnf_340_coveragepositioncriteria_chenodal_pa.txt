INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Chenodiol products are naturally occurring bile acids. Chenodal is indicated for
patients with radiolucent stones in well-opacifying gallbladders, in whom selective
surgery would be undertaken except for the presence of increased surgical risk due
to systemic disease or age.1 Ctexli is indicated for the treatment of
cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in adults.2
Disease Overview
Gallstones
The most widely used treatment for symptomatic gallstones is cholecystectomy.3
Two naturally occurring bile acids are used in the treatment of gallstones:
ursodeoxycholic acid (UrsoForte®, Urso-250®, [ursodiol tablets, generic], Actigall®
[ursodiol capsules, generic]) and chenodeoxycholic acid/chenodiol (Chenodal).4
These agents reduce biliary cholesterol; however, their exact mechanisms differ.
Both Chenodal and ursodiol promote the gradual dissolution of radiolucent
gallstones over a period of 6 months to 2 years.3
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX)
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Chenodiol Products Prior Authorization Policy
CTX is a lipid storage and bile acid synthesis disorder with various clinical
manifestations including juvenile cataracts, tendon xanthomas, premature
atherosclerosis, and progressive neurologic disturbance (e.g., ataxia, seizures,
psychiatric disorders, and peripheral neuropathy).5 Other conditions associated
with CTX include osteoarthritis, skeletal fractures, pulmonary insufficiency, renal
and hepatic calculi, and childhood chronic diarrhea. CTX is caused by pathogenic
variants in the cytochrome P450 (CYP)27A1 gene.7 This gene encodes for sterol
27-hydroxylase, an enzyme responsible for the conversion of cholesterol to cholic
acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (primary bile acids). Mutations in this gene lead to
27-hydroxylase deficiency and a subsequent reduction in primary bile acid
synthesis. In CTX, reduced synthesis of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids results
in failed feedback inhibition of cholesterol production, in turn leading to hallmark
laboratory findings of the disorder: increased serum cholestanol, a cholesterol
metabolite, and elevated urinary bile alcohols, like 23S-pentol.6 Replacement
therapy with chenodiol inhibits abnormal bile acid synthesis and is most effective in
reducing elevated plasma cholestanol concentrations and eliminating bile alcohols.5
As such, a CTX expert treatment panel concluded that treatment with chenodiol is
necessary to improve/stabilize prognosis in the majority of patients, regardless of
age or the presence of symptoms.7 Alongside the clinical manifestations,
biochemical and molecular genetic tests are typically used to diagnose CTX.
Diagnostic biochemical tests include detection of elevated serum cholestanol levels
while genetic tests include identification of pathogenic variants in the CYP27A1
gene.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of chenodiol
products. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
chenodiol products as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-
term efficacy, approval requires chenodiol products to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
I. Chenodal™ (chenodiol tablets - Travere)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Gallstones. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ONE of the following (A or
B):
A) Patient has tried an ursodiol product; OR
B) Patient is currently receiving an ursodiol product.

II. Ctexli™ (chenodiol tablets – Mirum)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
BOTH of the following (A and B):
A) The diagnosis is established by ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Patient has a molecular genetic test demonstrating a pathogenic variant
in the cytochrome P450 27A1 (CYP27A1) gene; OR
ii. Patient has a laboratory test demonstrating elevated serum cholestanol
levels; AND
B) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a geneticist,
neurologist, ophthalmologist, metabolic specialist who treats patients with
cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis or a specialist who focuses in the treatment
of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Chenodal™ (chenodiol tablets - Travere)
• Ctexli™ (chenodiol tablets – Mirum)
