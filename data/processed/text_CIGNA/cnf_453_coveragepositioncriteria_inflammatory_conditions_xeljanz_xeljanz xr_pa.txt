CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR is an inhibitor of the Janus kinases pathways.1 Xeljanz/Xeljanz
XR tablets are approved for the following uses:
• Ankylosing spondylitis, in adults with active disease who have had an
inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor
inhibitors (TNFis).
• Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), in patients ≥ 2 years of
age with active disease who have had an inadequate response or intolerance
to one or more TNFis. Note: This indication is for Xeljanz only (not the XR
formulation).
• Psoriatic arthritis, in adults with active disease who have had an inadequate
response or intolerance to one or more TNFis. In psoriatic arthritis,
Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR should be used in combination with a conventional
synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).
Page 1 of 11 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR Prior
Authorization Policy
• Rheumatoid arthritis, in adults with moderately to severely active disease
who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNFis.
• Ulcerative colitis, in adults with moderately to severely active disease who
have had an inadequate response or who are intolerant to one or more TNFis.
Xeljanz oral solution is only indicated for polyarticular JIA.
For all indications, Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR is not recommended for use in combination
with biologics or potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or cyclosporine.
Guidelines
Guidelines for the treatment of inflammatory conditions recommend use of
Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR.
• Ankylosing Spondylitis: Guidelines from the American College of
Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis
Research and Treatment Network (2019) recommend TNFis as the initial
biologic.8 In those who are secondary non-responders to a TNFi, a second TNFi
is recommended over switching out of the class. Both TNFis and interleukin-
17 blockers are recommended over Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR.
• JIA: Xeljanz is not addressed in ACR/Arthritis Foundation guidelines for the
treatment of JIA (2019) specific to juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis,
sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.2 TNFis are the biologics recommended for
polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Actemra® (tocilizumab intravenous
infusion, tocilizumab subcutaneous injection) and Orencia® (abatacept
intravenous infusion, abatacept subcutaneous injection) are also among the
biologics recommended for polyarthritis. Biologics are recommended following
other therapies (e.g., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following a
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for active JIA with sacroiliitis or
enthesitis). However, there are situations where initial therapy with a biologic
may be preferred over other conventional therapies (e.g., if there is
involvement of high-risk joints such as the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high
disease activity; and/or those judged to be at high risk of disabling joint
damage).
• Psoriatic arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2018) recommend TNFis over other
biologics and Xeljanz for use in treatment-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis
and in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.3
• Rheumatoid arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of
a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum
tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.4
• Ulcerative colitis: The AGA (2024) and the ACG (2025) have clinical practice
guidelines on the management of moderate to severe UC.5,6 In moderate to
severe disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be utilized
for induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended include TNF
inhibitors, Entyvio, IL-23 inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, sphingosine-1-
phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, and Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. If
steroids are utilized for induction, efforts should be made to introduce steroid-
sparing agents for maintenance therapy. Of note, guidelines state
corticosteroids may be avoided entirely when other effective induction
11 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR Prior
Authorization Policy
strategies are planned.6 Both guidelines also recommend that any drug that
effectively treats induction should be continued for maintenance.5,6
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of
Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In
cases where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days.
Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of a patient
treated with Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR as well as the monitoring required for adverse events
and long-term efficacy, initial approval requires Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR to be prescribed
by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Xeljanz®/Xeljanz XR (tofacitinib tablets, oral solution/extended-
release tablets – Pfizer)

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Xeljanz®/Xeljanz XR (tofacitinib tablets, oral solution/extended-
release tablets – Pfizer)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
2. Concurrent use with Other Potent Immunosuppressants (e.g.,
azathioprine, tacrolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil).1 Co-
11 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR Prior
Authorization Policy
administration with other potent immunosuppressive drugs has the risk of added
immunosuppression and has not been evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis. In
ulcerative colitis, Xeljanz is not recommended for use in combination with potent
immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine.
Note: This does NOT exclude use of Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR with methotrexate for
rheumatoid arthritis; Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR has been evaluated in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis taking background methotrexate, leflunomide, or
combinations of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) containing
methotrexate and/or leflunomide.
3. Renal Transplantation. More data are needed. A Phase IIb study in kidney
transplant patients (n = 331) found Xeljanz was equivalent to cyclosporine in
preventing acute rejection.7 However, based on Phase IIb studies, there are
concerns of Epstein Barr Virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative
disorder in certain transplant patients receiving Xeljanz.1,6
