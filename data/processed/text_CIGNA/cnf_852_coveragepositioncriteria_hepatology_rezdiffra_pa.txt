CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Rezdiffra, a thyroid hormone receptor-beta (THR-β) agonist, is indicated in combination with
diet and exercise for the treatment of non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis)
in adults.1 Limitations of Use: Avoid use in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.
This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on improvement of NASH and
fibrosis. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and
description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial.1
Disease Overview
Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common liver
disease in the US.11 MASLD is defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis with at least one
cardiometabolic risk (i.e., obesity, prediabetes/diabetes, hypertension, elevated
triglycerides, and/or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) in the absence of other
identifiable causes of liver disease or hepatic steatosis. Metabolic dysfunction-associated
steatohepatitis (MASH), a subtype of MASLD, is the progressive form of the disease.
Page 1 of 11 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hepatology – Rezdiffra Prior Authorization Policy
Previously, these conditions were known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), respectively, until the terminology was updated in
2023. MASH is characterized by the presence of ≥ 5% hepatic steatosis with hepatocellular
damage and inflammation in the absence of a readily identified alternative cause of
steatosis (e.g., medications, starvation, monogenic disorders) in individuals who drink little
or no alcohol (defined as < 20 g/day for women and < 30 g/day for men).2 Once MASH
progresses to clinically meaningful fibrosis (stages F2 and F3), the risk of adverse clinical
outcomes increases. In the US, it is estimated that more than one-third of adults have
MASLD11; 1.5% to 6.5% of adults have MASH.3 The estimated prevalence of high-risk
MASH (defined as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score [NAS] ≥ 4 and fibrosis
stage ≥ 2 [F2]) in the US is 5.8%. The risk of MASH is two- to three-fold higher in
individuals with obesity (25% to 30%) and/or type 2 diabetes (30% to 40%).4 In the US,
MASH is among the top causes of hepatocellular carcinoma and the second most common
indication for liver transplantation after hepatitis C.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Rezdiffra was evaluated in one ongoing, Phase III, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multicenter, pivotal study in adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH
(MAESTRO-NASH) with fibrosis (F1B, F2, or F3) [ n = 966].5 The dual primary endpoints at
Week 52 were 1) NASH resolution (achievement of a hepatocellular ballooning score = 0,
inflammation score = 0 or 1, and ≥ 2 point reduction in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
activity score [NAS]) with no worsening of fibrosis, and 2) ≥ 1 stage improvement in
fibrosis with no worsening of NAS. The key secondary endpoint was the percent reduction
in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) at Week 24. Patients who reached the Week
52 analysis were eligible to continue to the open-label extension with a primary endpoint of
a composite of all-cause mortality, liver transplant, and significant hepatic events (including
hepatic decompensation events [ascites, encephalopathy, or variceal hemorrhage],
histological progression to cirrhosis, and a confirmed increase of modified end-stage liver
disease [MELD] score from < 12 to ≥ 15). Eligible patients were ≥ 18 years of age, had at
least three of five metabolic risk factors according to the International Diabetes Foundation
criteria for metabolic syndrome9 (central obesity, elevated triglycerides [≥ 150 mg/dL],
reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [< 50 mg/dL in females or < 40 mg/dL in
males], elevated blood pressure [≥ 130/85 mmHg], elevated fasting plasma glucose [≥ 100
mg/dL]), and had undergone prescreening vibration-controlled transient elastography
(VCTE; FibroScan) within the past 3 months that showed a controlled attenuation parameter
of ≥ 280 dB/meter and a liver stiffness measurement of ≥ 8.5 kPa (alternately, a liver
biopsy that was performed within 6 months before randomization could be confirmed to be
eligible as a baseline biopsy by the central pathologist of the trial). Additional key inclusion
criteria were histologic evidence of NASH and an NAS of ≥ 4 (on a scale of 0 to 8 with
higher scores indicating more severe disease), with a score of ≥ 1 for each component
(steatosis [on a scale of 0 to 3], lobular inflammation [on a scale from 0 to 3], and
hepatocellular ballooning [on a scale from 0 to 2]). Key exclusion criteria were alcohol
consumption of > 20 g/day for women and > 30 g/day for men for a period of ≥ 3
consecutive months within 1 year of screening and causes of chronic liver disease other
than non-cirrhotic NASH.
The mean age was 57 years, the mean body mass index was 35.7 kg/m2, 67% of patients
had type 2 diabetes, 78% of patients had hypertension, and 71% of patients had
dyslipidemia (approximately 50% of patients were taking a statin).5 Glucagon-like receptor-
1 agonist use was reported in approximately 15% of patients. Most patients had a fibrosis
stage of F3 (62%), 33% of patients had F2, and 5% of patients had F1B. All patients
underwent lifestyle modification consisting of diet and exercise.
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hepatology – Rezdiffra Prior Authorization Policy
At Week 52, NASH resolution associated with a ≥ 2 point reduction in NAS without
worsening of fibrosis stage was reported for 29.9% and 25.9% of patients in the Rezdiffra
100 mg and 80 mg groups, respectively vs. 9.7% of patients in the placebo group (P <
0.0001 for Rezdiffra doses vs. placebo).5 The proportion of patients with ≥ 1 stage fibrosis
improvement with no worsening in NAS at Week 52 was 25.9% and 24.2% for Rezdiffra 100
mg and 80 mg, respectively vs. 14.2% for placebo (P < 0.0001 for Rezdiffra doses vs.
placebo). At Week 24, LDL-C was reduced by -16.3% and -13.6% with Rezdiffra 100 mg
and 80 mg, respectively, vs. +0.7% with placebo (P = 0.0001 Rezdiffra doses vs. placebo)
[key secondary endpoint]. Fewer patients treated with Rezdiffra vs. placebo with F1B or F2
at baseline progressed to ≥ F3 (18% to 19% vs. 34%, respectively) and more patients
treated with Rezdiffra vs. placebo with F1B or F2 at baseline had an improved fibrosis stage
(31% to 33% vs. 15%, respectively). A similar proportion of patients treated with Rezdiffra
and placebo with F1B or F2 at baseline had no change (stable) in fibrosis stage at Week 52
(48% to 51% vs. 51%, respectively).
Guidelines
An update to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) Practice
Guidance on the Clinical Management of NAFLD was published in October 2024 to address
the approval of Rezdiffra.10 It is recognized that although MASH can only be definitively
diagnosed by histologic exam (biopsy), in practice, patient selection is based on evidence of
steatosis and fibrosis as determined by non-invasive liver disease assessments (NILDAs) in
patients with cardiometabolic risk factors without other causes of steatosis, notably, alcohol
consumption of > 20 g/day for women and > 30 g/day in men. There are no FDA-approved
NILDAs to diagnose MASH with stage F2 to F3 fibrosis or to monitor the response to
pharmacotherapy. In general imaging-based NILDAs such as liver stiffness measurement
(LSM) by VCTE or magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) have better accuracy in
assessing fibrosis vs. blood-based tests. In general, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and
magnetic resonance imaging proton fat density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) are considered the
most accurate quantitative measures of hepatic steatosis, followed by VCTE-controlled
attenuation parameter score and gray scale ultrasound. However, for the purpose of
selecting patients for treatment with Rezdiffra, non-quantitative imaging evidence of hepatic
steatosis (e.g., ultrasonographic evidence) in individuals with at least one cardiometabolic
risk factor and F2 or F3 fibrosis may be sufficient. Liver biopsy is not typically
recommended for fibrosis staging in current clinical practice; however, histologic exam
remains the gold standard to quantify fibrosis if performed previously (historical biopsy
obtained reasonably recently, e.g., within 3 years). Since NILDAs are more readily available
than liver biopsy, it is recommended that more current data (e.g., within 6 to 12 months)
be utilized to determine patients who are appropriate candidates for treatment with
Rezdiffra. Regardless of treatment, the management of MASLD should include
comprehensive lifestyle modification (e.g., nutrition, exercise, and behavior modification)
and optimal control of comorbid metabolic conditions. Further, given the comorbidity profile
of individuals with MASLD, cardiovascular risk management is an important aspect of
medical management.
When selecting appropriate patients for treatment, Rezdiffra can be considered in adults
with MASH and moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with F2 or F3 fibrosis).10 The
diagnosis should be assessed by one of the following: 1) NILDA, preferably imaging-based
test results, consistent with MASH with stage F2 or F3 fibrosis; or 2) Historical liver biopsy
demonstrating MASH with stage F2 or F3 fibrosis (and without evidence of concomitant,
histologically active autoimmune liver disease). Rezdiffra is not recommended in patients
with the following: compensated or decompensated cirrhosis, concomitant uncontrolled
active liver diseases (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis), or alcohol
consumption > 20 grams/day (women) or > 30 grams/day (men), or symptomatic
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hepatology – Rezdiffra Prior Authorization Policy
gallstone-related conditions (e.g., acute cholecystitis). While some values for NILDAs (VCTE
and MRE) are cited within the update, for choosing patients appropriate for treatment with
Rezdiffra, they are not completely aligned with the MAESTRO-NASH trials, and the AASLD
notes that clinicians may consider expanded non-invasive criteria in making treatment
decisions.
The updated guidance also addresses the efficacy and futility of Rezdiffra treatment based
on the Week 52 data with Rezdiffra from MAESTRO-NASH.10 However, it is recognized that
these recommendations may change when longer-term data before available. The decision
to continue treatment beyond 12 months should be based on evidence of improvement,
worsening, treatment failure, or disease stabilization. Although the guidance provides
recommendations for continuing/re-evaluating treatment with Rezdiffra based on LSM
values for VCTE or MRE, reliable evidence to correlate LSM data with histologic changes in
liver fibrosis is lacking. Continuation of Rezdiffra in patients with significant fibrosis
improvement is recommended. In patients with evidence of worsening of liver disease at
Month 12, discontinuation of Rezdiffra should be considered. Worsening liver disease can
be identified by clinical data suggestive of worsening liver disease including consistent
increase in alanine aminotransferase or fibrosis progression as assessed by NILDA. In
patients without clear evidence of liver disease improvement or worsening, the decision to
continue therapy (pending longer-term data) should be based on holistic patient assessment
considering baseline fibrosis status and potential benefit of slowing or stabilizing liver
fibrosis even if no regression is noted; individual comorbidity profile associated with
progressive liver disease; concomitant therapy including adherence and response to lifestyle
interventions; changes in liver biochemical and NILDA parameters; and adverse effects (if
any) during treatment with Rezdiffra.
Other available guidelines do not address Rezdiffra. The AASLD (2023), American
Association of Clinical Endocrinology (2022), and American Gastroenterological Association
(AGA) [2021] provide guidelines and/or guidance on the overall management of NAFLD and
NASH.4,6,7 The goal of liver-directed treatment is to reverse steatohepatitis and fibrosis, or
to at least halt the progression of fibrosis.7 Importantly, the presence of steatosis serves
largely as a biomarker or risk factor of steatohepatitis with fibrosis; however, the presence
of steatosis does not necessarily imply severe disease. In general, in patients with NASH
with ≥ F2 fibrosis, agents approved for other indications that have shown benefit for NASH
in clinical trials should be considered under specific circumstances (e.g., diabetes,
obesity).4,6,7 A healthy diet and regular exercise are the foundation of treatment. Weight
loss of ≥ 10% is generally required to improve NASH fibrosis. Management of comorbid
conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes) should be done in-line with the
standard of care and encourage use of agents that have shown benefit in NASH (e.g.,
liraglutide, semaglutide, pioglitazone, vitamin E).
According to the AASLD, targeted screening of populations at increased risk for advanced
liver disease is advised to identify and manage those with clinically significant fibrosis (stage
≥ F2).2 The primary goal in the specialty care setting (gastroenterology, hepatology) is the
identification of patients with “at-risk” NASH or advanced fibrosis. Such patients require
further assessment and may benefit from targeted interventions. The AGA recommends
that at-risk patients be screened for alcohol use and have liver tests as well as a complete
blood count as part of the initial screening process.7 Results from standard laboratory tests
can allow calculation of simple fibrosis scores using non-invasive tests for fibrosis (e.g.,
Fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] or NAS). Patients with a FIB-4 of ≥ 1.3 to ≤ 2.67 are considered to be at
indeterminate risk and should undergo an LSM, ultrasound is acceptable if VCTE (Fibroscan)
is unavailable. Other methods such as bidimensional shear wave elastography or point
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hepatology – Rezdiffra Prior Authorization Policy
shear wave elastography can also be used to measure LSM. If the LSM by VCTE is ≥ 8 kPa
to ≤ 12 kPa, patients are considered to be at indeterminate risk, and referral to a
hepatologist for liver biopsy or MRE or monitoring with re-evaluation in 2 to 3 years is
recommended. Of note, an LSM of ≥ 8.0 equates to clinically significant fibrosis (≥ F2); an
LSM < 8.0 is considered low risk for clinically significant fibrosis and can be managed with
repeat surveillance testing in 2 to 3 years. Patients with a FIB-4 > 2.67 are considered high
risk and should be referred to a hepatologist. Additionally, patients with a LSM > 12 kPa or
a liver biopsy showing F2 to F4 fibrosis are also considered high risk.

Initial Therapy. The timeframe requirement for a patient with a liver
biopsy was changed to be within the 3 years preceding treatment
with Rezdiffra [documentation required], previously within the past 6
months preceding treatment with Rezdiffra [documentation
required].
Patient is Currently Taking Rezdiffra. Criteria that the patient that
has completed ≥ 1 year and < 2 years of therapy with Rezdiffra and
has derived benefit from treatment with Rezdiffra as demonstrated
by one of the following, according to the prescriber: 1) MASH/NASH
resolution AND no worsening of fibrosis; OR No worsening of
MASH/NASH AND improvement in fibrosis by ≥ 1 stage was removed
from the policy. A patient that has completed ≥ 1 year of therapy
with Rezdiffra is now reviewed under the same criterion that was
previously applied for a patient that has completed ≥ 2 years of
therapy with Rezdiffra. As revised, a patient that has completed ≥ 1
