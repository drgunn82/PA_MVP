ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP

IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT
ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING
COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED
ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING
INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT
PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES.
IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Vyleesi is indicated for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired,
generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) as characterized by low
sexual desire that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty and is NOT due to:
a co-existing medical or psychiatric condition, problems with the relationship, or effects
of a medication or drug substance.
Limitations of Use: Vyleesi is not indicated for the treatment of HSDD in
postmenopausal women or in men. Vyleesi is not indicated to enhance sexual
performance.1 In Vyleesi pivotal studies, patients were excluded if they were diagnosed
with or being treated for depression, psychosis, bipolar disorder, or substance abuse
within 6 months before screening.2 The prescribing information for Vyleesi notes that it
should be discontinued after 8 weeks if the patient does not report an improvement in
symptoms.1
Guidelines
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guideline on Female Sexual
Dysfunction (2019) notes the importance of recognizing if the loss of sexual interest is
due to a co-morbid or undiagnosed condition, or medication.3 Consultation with or
referral to a mental health specialist with expertise and training in the treatment of
female sexual dysfunction (e.g., sex therapists, psychologists, marriage/relationship

patient’s individual needs. The guideline does not address Vyleesi.
