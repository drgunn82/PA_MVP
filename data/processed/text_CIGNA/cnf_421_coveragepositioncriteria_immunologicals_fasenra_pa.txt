CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Fasenra, an interleukin-5 receptor alpha (IL-5Rα)-directed cytolytic monoclonal
antibody, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Asthma as add-on maintenance treatment of patients ≥ 6 years of age with
severe disease and an eosinophilic phenotype. Limitations of Use: Fasenra is
not indicated for the treatment of other eosinophilic conditions or for the relief
of acute bronchospasm/status asthmaticus.
• Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in adults.
Clinical Efficacy
Asthma
In two pivotal asthma studies, the addition of Fasenra to existing therapy significantly
reduced annualized asthma exacerbation rates in patients with baseline blood
eosinophil levels ≥ 300 cells/microliter.2-4 The magnitude of the improvements
observed with Fasenra in this patient population were larger than those observed in
Page 1 of 8 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Immunologicals – Fasenra Prior Authorization Policy
patients with lower baseline eosinophil levels (e.g., < 150 cells/microliter). Another
pivotal study involved adults with severe asthma receiving high-dose inhaled
corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting beta -agonist (LABA) and chronic oral corticosteroid
2
therapy who had a baseline blood eosinophil level ≥ 150 cells/microliter.4
Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis
One study evaluated the efficacy of Fasenra in patients ≥ 18 years of age with
relapsing or refractory EGPA who had received ≥ 4 weeks of a stable oral
corticosteroid dose (i.e., prednisolone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, or
hydrocortisone).13 The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in remission
at both Week 36 and Week 48.
Guidelines
The Global Initiative for Asthma Global Strategy for Asthma Management and
Prevention (2024) proposes a step-wise approach to asthma treatment.5 Fasenra is
listed as an option for add-on therapy in patients ≥ 12 years of age with severe
eosinophilic asthma. Severe asthma is defined as asthma that is uncontrolled despite
adherence to optimized high-dose ICS/LABA therapy or that worsens when high-dose
treatment is decreased. Of note, guidelines have not been updated since the lower
age indication of Fasenra was FDA-approved. Higher blood eosinophil levels, higher
number of severe exacerbations in the previous year, adult-onset asthma, nasal
polyps, maintenance oral corticosteroid requirements, and low lung function may
predict a good asthma response to Fasenra.
According to the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society
guidelines (2014; updated in 2020), severe asthma is defined as asthma which
requires treatment with a high-dose ICS in addition to a second controller
medication (and/or systemic corticosteroids) to prevent it from becoming
uncontrolled, or asthma which remains uncontrolled despite this therapy.6,7
Uncontrolled asthma is defined as asthma that worsens upon tapering of high-dose
ICS or systemic corticosteroids or asthma that meets one of the following four
criteria:
1) Poor symptom control: Asthma Control Questionnaire consistently ≥ 1.5 or
Asthma Control Test < 20;
2) Frequent severe exacerbations: two or more bursts of systemic corticosteroids
in the previous year;
3) Serious exacerbations: at least one hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, or
mechanical ventilation in the previous year;
4) Airflow limitation: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) < 80%
1
predicted after appropriate bronchodilator withholding.
Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis Guidelines
The American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Vasculitis Foundation Guideline for the
Management of Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated (ANCA) Vasculitis
(2021) includes recommendations regarding the management of EGPA.14 Fasenra is
not addressed. However, for patients with active, non-severe EGPA, combination
therapy with an anti-IL-5 agent and a corticosteroid is recommended over other
Page 2 of 8 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Immunologicals – Fasenra Prior Authorization Policy
traditional treatments such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil
in the setting of remission induction. Non-severe EGPA is defined as vasculitis in the
absence of life- or organ-threatening manifestations. In general, the clinical profile
includes rhinosinusitis, asthma, mild systemic symptoms, uncomplicated cutaneous
disease, and mild inflammatory arthritis. An anti-IL-5 agent, in combination with
corticosteroids, is also a recommended therapy for patients who have relapsed and
are experiencing non-severe disease manifestations (i.e., asthma and/or sinonasal
disease) while receiving either low-dose corticosteroids alone, methotrexate,
azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil. For patients with severe EGPA,
cyclophosphamide or rituximab is preferred over an anti-IL-5 agents for remission
induction. The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR)
recommendations for the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis (2022) also do
not yet address Fasenra.15 However, similar to the ACR guidelines, EULAR
recommends an anti-IL-5 agent for induction of remission in patients with relapsing
or refractory EGPA without active organ- or life-threatening disease. It is also
recommended for maintenance of remission in these patients. Additionally, it is also
among the many recommended treatment options for the maintenance of remission
of EGPA after induction of remission for organ-threatening or life-threatening disease.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Fasenra. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Fasenra as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Fasenra to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes
in the condition being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Fasenra® (benralizumab subcutaneous injection – AstraZeneca)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Fasenra is not indicated for
the treatment of COPD.1 One double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase IIa study
(n = 101) evaluated the efficacy and safety of Fasenra in patients 40 to 80 years
of age with eosinophilia and moderate to severe COPD.8 The annualized rate of
acute COPD exacerbations was not reduced with Fasenra compared with placebo.
Lung function was also not significantly improved with Fasenra vs. placebo.
Numerically greater (although non-significant) improvements in exacerbations
and lung function were observed with Fasenra vs. placebo in patients with baseline
blood eosinophil levels of 200 cells/microliter or more. Two double-blind, placebo-
controlled, Phase III studies (GALATHEA and TERRANOVA) also evaluated Fasenra
in patients with moderate to very severe COPD (n = 1,120 and n = 1,545 patients,
respectively, with eosinophils ≥ 220 cells/mm3).9 Following, 56 weeks of therapy,
the annualized COPD exacerbation rates were not statistically significantly
reduced with Fasenra vs. placebo in either study. Current COPD guidelines from
the Global Initiative for Chronic Lung Disease (2025) note the inconsistent data
with Fasenra and state that further studies are needed.10
2. Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria. Fasenra is not indicated for the treatment of
chronic spontaneous urticaria.1 One double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase IIb
study (ARROYO) [n = 155] evaluated the efficacy and safety of several doses of
Fasenra in adults with chronic spontaneous urticaria who were currently receiving
H1 antihistamine treatment.17 Despite near-complete depletion of blood
eosinophils, at Week 12, there were no significant differences in the change from
baseline in the Itch Severity Score 7 or the Urticaria Activity Score 7 between any
of the Fasenra doses and placebo. There were also no differences between
Fasenra and placebo for any of the secondary endpoints evaluated.
3. Concurrent use of Fasenra with another Monoclonal Antibody Therapy.
The efficacy and safety of Fasenra used in combination with other monoclonal
antibody therapies have not been established.
Note: Monoclonal antibody therapies are Adbry® (tralokinumab-ldrm
subcutaneous injection), Cinqair® (reslizumab intravenous infusion), Dupixent®
(dupilumab subcutaneous injection), Ebglyss® (lebrikizumab-lbkz subcutaneous
injection), Nemluvio® (nemolizumab-ilto subcutaneous injection), Nucala®
(mepolizumab subcutaneous injection), Tezspire® (tezepelumab-ekko
subcutaneous injection), or Xolair® (omalizumab subcutaneous injection).
Page 6 of 8 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Immunologicals – Fasenra Prior Authorization Policy
4. Hypereosinophilic Syndrome. Fasenra is not indicated for the treatment of
eosinophilic conditions other than asthma.1 A small, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, Phase II trial (n = 20) evaluated the efficacy of Fasenra in
patients who had platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA)-
negative hypereosinophilic syndrome with an absolute eosinophil count of 1,000
cells/mm3.11 At Week 12, 90% of patients receiving Fasenra (n = 9/10) vs. 30%
of patients receiving placebo (n = 3/10) achieved a 50% or greater reduction in
the absolute eosinophil count (P = 0.02). Following the randomized phase, all
patients received open-label Fasenra 30 mg every 4 weeks. During this time, 74%
of patients (n = 14/19) had sustained clinical and hematologic responses for 48
weeks. Of these responders, 10 patients were followed for at least 8 years
(maximum exposure 10.1 years).16 During this time, Fasenra continued to
suppress eosinophil counts in all patients. The World Health Organization (WHO)
and international consensus classification of eosinophilic disorders update on
diagnosis, risk stratification, and management (2024) acknowledges that Fasenra
has been studied in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome.12 At this time, the
WHO notes that Fasenra remains investigational. Available data with Fasenra is
discussed, but this therapy continues to be considered investigational. A Phase
III study of Fasenra in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome is currently
underway, with primary completion anticipated in May 2025.
