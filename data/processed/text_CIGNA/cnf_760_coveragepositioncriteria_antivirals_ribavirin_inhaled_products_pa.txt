INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside with antiviral activity.1 Ribavirin inhalation solution
(referred to as aerosolized ribavirin in this policy) is indicated for the treatment of
hospitalized infants and young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections
due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Treatment early in the course of severe
lower respiratory tract infection may be necessary to achieve efficacy.
Disease Overview
RSV causes seasonal annual epidemics worldwide with year-round disease seen in
some tropical locations. By 2 years of age, most children have experienced a primary
infection; re-infection can occur throughout life.3 Subsequent infections are usually
less severe than a primary infection, particularly among otherwise healthy older
children and adults. Recurrent RSV infection manifests as mild upper respiratory
tract illness and seldom involves the lower respiratory tract.2
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Antivirals – Ribavirin (Inhaled Products) Prior
Authorization Policy
Aerosolized ribavirin has also been used off-label in adults for RSV and for other
respiratory viral infections, most commonly in immunocompromised patients.3,4
Guidelines
The American Academy of Pediatrics (2024) states that no available treatment
shortens the course of bronchiolitis or hastens the resolution of RSV symptoms.2
Management of young children hospitalized with bronchiolitis is supportive. Because
of limited evidence for a clinically relevant benefit, potential toxic effects, and high
cost, routine use of aerosolized ribavirin is not recommended.
Guidelines from the American Society of Transplantation Infectious Diseases
Community of Practice (2019) recommend aerosolized ribavirin in lung transplant
recipients with upper or lower respiratory tract infection.3 Treatment with aerosolized
or oral ribavirin for non-solid organ recipients with lower respiratory tract disease can
be considered. Aerosolized ribavirin is also a therapeutic option in lung transplant
recipients with parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for the prevention and
treatment of cancer-related infections (version 1.2024 – April 30, 2024) recommend
consideration of aerosolized ribavirin for the treatment of lower respiratory tract RSV
disease (category 3).4 Comments related to the recommendation are to limit use to
patients undergoing stem cell transplant or with leukemia and, that despite limited
information in immunocompromised adults with RSV, use should be considered given
the potential morbidity and mortality associated with RSV infection.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of aerosolized
ribavirin. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where
the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
aerosolized ribavirin as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-
term efficacy, approval requires aerosolized ribavirin to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Virazole® (ribavirin inhalation solution - Bausch,
generic)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Treatment. Approve for 1 month if the
patient meets ALL of the following (A, B, and C):
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Antivirals – Ribavirin (Inhaled Products) Prior Authorization Policy
A) Patient is < 2 years of age; AND
B) Patient is hospitalized; AND
C) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a critical care specialist,
infectious diseases physician, or pulmonologist.
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
2. Respiratory Virus Treatment, Excluding COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease
2019). Approve for 1 month if the patient meets ALL of the following (A, B, and
C):
A) Patient is hospitalized; AND
B) Patient meets ONE of the following (i, ii, or iii):
i. Patient is a solid organ transplant recipient; OR
ii. Patient has had a hematopoietic stem cell transplant; OR
iii. Patient has cancer; AND
C) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a critical care specialist,
transplant physician, oncologist, infectious diseases physician, or
pulmonologist.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Virazole® (ribavirin inhalation solution - Bausch,
generic)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019). Data are preliminary, additional
study is needed.5,6 A Phase I, open-label, non-US (Greece, Brazil, and Mexico),
non-randomized, two-arm study was conducted to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of aerosolized ribavirin (as Virazole) in hospitalized adults with significant
respiratory distress due to COVID-19 (n = 51).5 Patients received aerosolized
ribavirin (100mg/mL for 30min or 50mg/mL for 60min) twice daily for up to 6
days. Improvement of one or more level in clinical status severity was observed
in 31.4% (n = 16/51) and 78.4% (n = 40/51) of patients at end-of-treatment and
Day 30, respectively. Of 21 patients who required a ventilator, 16 (76.2%) were
able to discontinue ventilator use. One case series reported on five hospitalized
adults with COVID-19 who received aerosolized ribavirin (100 mg/mL twice daily
for 6 days) as part of a compassionate use program in Italy (patients were also
managed in accordance with Italian treatment guidelines for COVID).6 All patients
fully recovered. Ribavirin is not addressed as a recommended treatment modality
in guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America or the National
Institutes of Health.7,8
