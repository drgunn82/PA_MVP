REVIEW DATE: 06/04/2025; selected revision 07/23/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Simponi subcutaneous injection, a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), is
approved for the following uses:1
• Ankylosing spondylitis, in adults with active disease either alone or in
combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
• Psoriatic arthritis, in adults with active disease either alone or in
combination with methotrexate or other non-biologic DMARDs.
• Rheumatoid arthritis, in adults with moderate to severe active disease in
combination with methotrexate.
• Ulcerative colitis, for inducing and maintaining clinical response, improving
endoscopic appearance of the mucosa during induction, inducing clinical
remission, and achieving and sustaining clinical remission in induction
responders in adults with moderate to severe disease who have demonstrated
Page 1 of 9 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Simponi Subcutaneous Prior
Authorization Policy
corticosteroid dependence or who have had an inadequate response to or
failed to tolerate oral aminosalicylates, oral corticosteroids, azathioprine, or 6-
mercaptopurine.
Guidelines
TNFis are featured prominently in guidelines for treatment of inflammatory
conditions.
• Psoriatic Arthritis: Guidelines from American College of Rheumatology
(ACR) [2019] recommend TNFis over other biologics for use in treatment-
naïve patients and in those who were previously treated with an oral
therapy.3
• Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of
a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum
tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.4
• Spondyloarthritis: Guidelines for ankylosing spondylitis and non-
radiographic axial spondylitis are published by the ACR/Spondylitis
Association of America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network
(2019).2 TNFis are recommended as the initial biologic. In those who are
secondary non-responders to a TNFi, a second TNFi is recommended over
switching out of the class.
• Ulcerative Colitis: The AGA (2024) and the ACG (2025) have clinical
practice guidelines on the management of moderate to severe UC.5,8 In
moderate to severe disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies
may be utilized for induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended
include TNF inhibitors, Entyvio® (vedolizumab), interleukin (IL)-23 inhibitors,
IL-12/23 inhibitors, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, and
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. If steroids are utilized for induction, efforts
should be made to introduce steroid-sparing agents for maintenance therapy.
Of note, guidelines state corticosteroids may be avoided entirely when other
effective induction strategies are planned.8 Both guidelines also recommend
that any drug that effectively treats induction should be continued for
maintenance.5,8
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Simponi
Subcutaneous. All approvals are provided for the duration listed below. In cases
where the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because
of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated
with Simponi Subcutaneous as well as the monitoring required for adverse events
and long-term efficacy, initial approval requires Simponi Subcutaneous to be
prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition
being treated.
• Simponi® (golimumab subcutaneous injection – Janssen)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Simponi® (golimumab subcutaneous injection – Janssen)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination
with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used
for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination
therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of
adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination
with this medication.
2. Plaque Psoriasis without Psoriatic Arthritis. Simponi Subcutaneous is
indicated in patients with psoriatic arthritis, but it has not been evaluated and it
Page 6 of 9 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Simponi Subcutaneous Prior
Authorization Policy
is not indicated in patients with plaque psoriasis without psoriatic arthritis.
Prospective, controlled trials are needed to determine safety and efficacy in
plaque psoriasis. Other TNFis (e.g., etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab
products, Cimzia® [certolizumab pegol subcutaneous injection]) are indicated for
the treatment of plaque psoriasis.
