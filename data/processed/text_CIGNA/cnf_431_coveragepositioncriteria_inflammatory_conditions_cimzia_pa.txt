CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Cimzia, a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), is indicated for the following uses:1
• Ankylosing spondylitis, for the treatment of adults with active disease.
• Crohn’s disease, for reducing signs and symptoms and maintaining clinical
responses in adults with moderate to severe active disease who have had an
inadequate response to conventional therapy.
• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), for treatment of active polyarticular
disease in patients ≥ 2 years of age.
• Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, in patients with objective signs
of inflammation.
• Plaque psoriasis, for the treatment of adults with moderately to severely
active disease who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
• Psoriatic arthritis, for the treatment of adult patients with active disease.
• Rheumatoid arthritis, for the treatment of adults with moderately to
severely active disease.
Cimzia may be used as monotherapy or in combination with conventional synthetic
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

Policy
Guidelines
TNFis feature prominently in guidelines for treatment of inflammatory conditions.
• Axial Spondyloarthritis and Spondyloarthritis: Guidelines for ankylosing
spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis are published by the
American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of
America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network (2019).2 TNFis
are recommended for the initial biologic. In those who are secondary
nonresponders to a TNFi, a second TNFi is recommended over switching out of
the class.
• Crohn’s Disease: The American College of Gastroenterology has guidelines
for Crohn’s disease (2018).3 TNFis are listed as an option for disease that is
resistant to corticosteroids, severely active disease, perianal fistulizing
disease, and maintenance of remission. In post-operative Crohn’s disease, a
TNFi should be started within 4 weeks of surgery to prevent recurrence.
Guidelines from the American Gastroenterological Association (2021) include
TNFis among the therapies for moderate to severe Crohn’s disease, for
induction and maintenance of remission.7
• JIA: There are guidelines from ACR and the Arthritis Foundation for the
treatment of JIA (2021) which address oligoarthritis and temporomandibular
joint (TMJ) arthritis.8 For oligoarthritis, a biologic is recommended following a
trial of a conventional synthetic DMARD. In patients with TMJ arthritis,
scheduled nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or intra-
articular glucocorticoids are recommended first-line. A biologic is a therapeutic
option if there is an inadequate response or intolerance. Additionally, rapid
escalation to a biologic ± conventional synthetic DMARD (methotrexate
preferred) is often appropriate given the impact and destructive nature of TMJ
arthritis. In these guidelines, there is not a preferred biologic that should be
initiated for JIA. There are also guidelines from the ACR/Arthritis Foundation
for the treatment of JIA (2019) specific to juvenile non-systemic polyarthritis,
sacroiliitis, and enthesitis.9 TNFis are the biologics recommended for
polyarthritis, sacroiliitis, and enthesitis. Biologics are recommended following
other therapies (e.g., following DMARDs for active polyarthritis or following an
NSAID for active JIA with sacroiliitis or enthesitis). However, there are
situations where initial therapy with a biologic may be preferred over other
conventional therapies (e.g., if there is involvement of high-risk joints such as
the cervical spine, wrist, or hip; high disease activity; and/or those judged to
be at high risk of disabling joint damage). TNFis may also be used as second-
or third-line treatment for systemic JIA.10
• Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatologists
and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend TNFis as a monotherapy
treatment option for adults with moderate to severe disease.4 Based on
extrapolation of data, Cimzia is likely to have class characteristics similar to
the other TNFis.
• Psoriatic Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2018) generally recommend
treatment with a TNFi over other therapies as initial treatment for patients who
are treatment-naïve.5
9 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Cimzia Prior Authorization
Policy
• Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2021) recommend addition of
a biologic or a targeted synthetic DMARD for a patient taking the maximum
tolerated dose of methotrexate who is not at target.6
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Cimzia. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Cimzia as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Cimzia to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes
in the condition being treated.
• Cimzia® (certolizumab pegol subcutaneous injection [lyophilized
powder or solution] – UCB)

is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria
will be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination
with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used
for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination
therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of
adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination
with this medication.
