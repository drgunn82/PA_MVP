INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Arcalyst, an interleukin-1 blocker, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), including familial cold
autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS), for
treatment of patients ≥ 12 years of age.
• Deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), for
maintenance of remission in patients weighing at least 10 kg.

Page 1 of 3 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Arcalyst Drug Quantity
Management Policy – Per Days
• In adults, initiate treatment with a loading dose of 320 mg delivered as two
subcutaneous (SC) injections of 160 mg/2 mL each, administered on the
same day at two different injection sites.1 Continue dosing with a 160 mg
once weekly (QW) administered as a single, 2 mL SC injection.
• In pediatric patients 12 years to 17 years of age, initiate treatment with a
loading dose of 4.4 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 320 mg, administered
as one or two SC injections, not to exceed single-injection volume of 2 mL
per injection site. If the initial dose is given as two injections, administer on
the same day at two different sites. Continue dosing with a QW injection of
2.2 mg/kg, up to a maximum of 160 mg, administered as a single SC
injection, up to 2 mL.
• If a QW dose is missed, instruct the patient to administer the injection within
7 days from the missed dose and then resume the patient’s original
schedule. If the missed dose is not administered within 7 days, instruct the
patient to administer the dose, starting a new schedule based on this date.
DIRA:
• In adults, the recommended dose is 320 mg, once weekly, administered as
two SC injections on the same day at two different sites with a maximum
single-injection volume of 2 mL. Arcalyst should not be given more often
than QW.
• In pediatric patients who weigh ≥ 10 kg, the recommended dose is 4.4
mg/kg (up to a maximum of 320 mg) QW, administered as one or two SC
injections with a maximum single-injection volume of 2 mL. If the dose is
given as two injections, administer both on the same day, each one at a
different site.
Based on prescribing information, four of the 220 mg vials are adequate for a 28-
day supply. Exceptions can be made for patients initiating therapy or patients with
DIRA.
Availability
Arcalyst is supplied as a lyophilized powder in single-dose vials each containing 220
mg of Arcalyst.1 Each vial is supplied in a carton containing one or four vials.
