INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Eliquis, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Non-valvular atrial fibrillation, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic
embolism in adults.
• Prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary
embolism (PE), in adults who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery.
• Treatment of DVT and PE, as well as reduction in the risk of recurrence of
DVT and PE following initial therapy, in adults.
• Treatment of VTE and reduction in the risk of recurrent VTE in pediatric
patients from birth and older at least 5 days after initial anticoagulant treatment.
It is noted in the prescribing information for Eliquis that different dosage forms can be
utilized to achieve the necessary dose for pediatric patients.1 Not all dosage forms are
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Anticoagulants – Eliquis Prior Authorization Policy
approved for the same indication and age groups. Eliquis Sprinkle is available as a 0.15 mg
strength and can be used for patients 2.6 to less than 4 kg. Eliquis tablets for oral
suspension are available as a 0.5 mg strength and can be used for patients 4 to 35 kg.
Eliquis also remains available as 2.5 and 5 mg tablets; these can be used for patients ≥ 35
kg. Eliquis/Eliquis Sprinkle are not recommended for use in pediatric patients less than 2.6
kg because it was not studied in these patients.
Guidelines
Guidelines are available which support the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in their
commonly used clinical settings, such as DVT/PE2-5 and atrial fibrillation.6,7 In patients who
are eligible for a DOAC, these are generally preferred over vitamin K antagonists (e.g.,
warfarin). It is noted that in the randomized trials in atrial fibrillation, DOACs were
consistently at least non-inferior to warfarin regarding the composite of stroke or systemic
embolism and were associated with a lower risk of serious bleeding.7
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
Although data are not robust regarding use of DOACs in other off-label thromboembolic-
related conditions, American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines (2024) suggest
anticoagulation for certain patients (e.g., superficial vein thrombosis,).2 The choice of
anticoagulant is often individualized based on patient-specific factors; therefore, for certain
patients, DOAC use may be considered in practice. Evidence for DOACs is limited for off-
label scenarios; in general, there is more clinical experience with agents such as vitamin K
antagonists (e.g., warfarin) and low molecular weight heparin in these settings.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Eliquis® (apixaban tablets and tablets for oral suspension - Bristol-Myers
Squibb/Pfizer)
• Eliquis® Sprinkle (apixaban capsules for oral suspension – Bristol-Myers
Squibb/Pfizer)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including the
following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as new
published data are available):
1. Venous Thromboembolism in an Acutely Ill Medical Patient, Prophylaxis. Eliquis
has been compared with enoxaparin for post-discharge prophylaxis in acutely ill medical
patients; however, superiority vs. enoxaparin was not achieved, and bleeding was
increased with Eliquis.10 Xarelto is labeled for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism
in acutely ill medical patients and is supported in clinical practice guidelines.
