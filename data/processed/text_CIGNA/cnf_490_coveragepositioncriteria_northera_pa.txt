INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Droxidopa, a norepinephrine-type product, is indicated for the treatment of
orthostatic dizziness, lightheadedness, or the “feeling that one is about to black out”
in adults with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) caused
by primary autonomic failure (Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, and pure
autonomic failure), dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency, and non-diabetic
autonomic neuropathy.1
Disease Overview
Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a sustained reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP)
of at least 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 10 mmHg within 3 minutes
of standing or head-up tilt to at least 60° on a tilt table.2 OH may be symptomatic
or asymptomatic, with only symptomatic OH requiring treatment. NOH is a specific
subset of this condition, in which OH is due to inadequate release of norepinephrine
from sympathetic vasomotor neurons leading to vasoconstrictor failure. NOH is a
rare, chronic and often debilitating condition that is associated with Parkinson’s
disease, multiple system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure, and with peripheral
neuropathies and ganglionopathies that affect the autonomic nerves.2-4 Symptoms
of NOH include dizziness, lightheadedness, blurred vision, fatigue, and fainting upon
standing up. These symptoms can adversely affect patients’ quality of life and ability
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Droxidopa Prior Authorization Policy
to conduct activities of daily living that involve standing or walking. Treatment of
symptomatic NOH is aimed at increasing standing systolic blood pressure into the
range of compensatory cerebrovascular autoregulation (approximately 50 to 150
mmHg).5 Unapproved pharmacologic agents include fludrocortisone,
dihydroergotamine (oral), indomethacin (oral or intravenous), pyridostigmine, and
atomoxetine.2-4,6 Midodrine, an alpha -agonist, is the only other medication approved
1
with a similar indication (treatment of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension) to
droxidopa.7
Guidelines
Consensus panel recommendations initiated by the American Autonomic Society and
the National Parkinson Foundation for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of NOH
and associated supine hypertension were published in 2017.8 Once a patient is
diagnosed with NOH, the goals of treatment should be to reduce the burden of
symptoms (especially falls), prolong standing time, and restore independence in
activities of daily living. The recommendations propose a four-step treatment
algorithm for NOH: assessing and adjusting preexisting medications that may be
causing or exacerbating NOH, utilizing non-pharmacologic approaches (e.g., blood
volume repletion, increased salt intake, physical conditioning, compression garments,
elevating the head of the bed), implementing single-agent pharmacologic treatment,
and with great caution, combining pharmacologic treatments. Recommended
treatments include midodrine, droxidopa, fludrocortisone, and pyridostigmine. The
initial choice of NOH treatments should be individualized and should consider
severity, comorbid disease (especially cardiac or renal failure), and treatment goals.
Based on the experience of the consensus panel, the recommendation is to titrate to
maximum tolerable dose of a single medication and then, if symptomatic benefit is
not obtained, consider switching to a different medication or adding a second agent
and titrate from its lowest starting dose.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of droxidopa.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with droxidopa as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires droxidopa to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
Northera® (droxidopa capsules – Lundbeck, generic)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for fda-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Droxidopa Prior Authorization Policy

ALL of the following (A, B, C, D, and E):
A) Patient is > 18 years of age; AND
B) Patient has been diagnosed with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic
hypotension due to primary autonomic failure (Parkinson’s disease, multiple
system atrophy, and pure autonomic failure), dopamine beta-hydroxylase
deficiency, or non-diabetic autonomic neuropathy; AND
C) Patient has tried two other medications for the treatment of neurogenic
orthostatic hypotension; AND
Note: Examples of other medications for the treatment of neurogenic
orthostatic hypotension include atomoxetine, dihydroergotamine,
fludrocortisone, indomethacin, midodrine, and pyridostigmine.
D) Patient has initiated non-pharmacological measures including but not limited
to elevation of the head of the bed, orthostatic compression garments, and
