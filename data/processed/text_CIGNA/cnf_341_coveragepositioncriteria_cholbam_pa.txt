INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Cholbam, a bile acid, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects (SEDs).
• Peroxisomal disorders (PDs), including Zellweger spectrum disorders,
as adjunctive treatment in patients who exhibit manifestations of liver disease,
steatorrhea, or complications from decreased fat soluble vitamin absorption.
The effects of Cholbam on extrahepatic manifestations (e.g., neurologic symptoms)
of bile acid synthesis disorders due to SEDs or PDs have not been established.1 The
prescribing information states that treatment with Cholbam should be discontinued if
liver function does not improve within 3 months of the start of treatment or if
complete biliary obstruction develops.
Bile Acid Synthesis Disorders
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Cholbam Prior Authorization Policy
Bile acids are found in the liver and have several biological roles, including promotion
of bile flow and intestinal absorption of fat and fat soluble vitamins.2 The two primary
bile acids are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (available as Chenodal®
[chenodiol tablets]). Bile acids are formed from cholesterol; inadequate bile acid
production leads to accumulation of cholesterol in the body, as well as other
intermediary metabolites. This can result in damage to various organ systems.
Severe cases may progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Progressive neurologic
disease may also occur, even in the absence of liver disease.
There are at least 17 known enzymes involved in bile acid synthesis. Primary bile
acid synthesis disorders may be caused by a defect in the gene encoding any one of
these enzymes. Enrollment criteria in the pivotal studies with Cholbam were based
on abnormal urinary bile acids analysis by Fast Atom Bombardment ionization – mass
spectrometry (FAB-MS).1 However, gene sequencing is now available for many of
the affected enzymes.
Peroxisomal Disorders (PDs)
PDs occur due to genetic mutations to genes that are essential to the proper
formation of peroxisomes.3 Among their many roles, peroxisomes are vital to the
production of bile acids, as well as for neurologic function. Zellweger spectrum
disorder is a type of PD and may be severe (Zellweger syndrome) or
intermediate/milder (previously called neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile
Refsum disease, or Heimler syndrome).4 Enrollment criteria in the pivotal trials were
based on abnormal urinary bile acids analysis by FAB-MS and a neurologic exam.1
However, molecular genetic testing is now available.4
GUIDELINES
A joint guideline by the North American and European Societies for Pediatric
Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition is available (2017).5 The guideline,
which briefly addresses evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants, provides
recommendations for diagnosis of bile acid synthesis disorders. While it is possible to
perform rapid diagnosis of potential inborn errors in bile acid synthesis from urinary
bile acid analysis, FAB-MS of urine is recommended. The guideline also notes that
molecular techniques identify the specific mutations in genes encoding enzymes
responsible for bile acid synthesis.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Cholbam. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Cholbam as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Cholbam to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated.
