INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Xalkori, an oral kinase inhibitor, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), treatment of relapsed or
refractory, systemic ALCL that is anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive
in pediatric patients ≥ 1 year of age and young adults.
Limitation of Use: The safety and efficacy of Xalkori have not been
established in older adults with relapsed or refractory, systemic ALK-positive
ALCL.
• Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT), treatment of unresectable,
recurrent, or refractory IMT that is ALK-positive in patients ≥ 1 year of age.
• Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic, whose tumors are ALK-
positive or ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1)-positive as detected by an FDA-
approved test in adults.

Positive Agent) – Xalkori Drug Quantity Management Policy – Per Rx
Dosing
ALCL
For pediatric patients ≥ 1 year of age and young adults with relapsed or refractory,
systemic ALK-positive ALCL, the recommended dose is 280 mg/m2 twice daily (BID)
until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.1 Refer to Table 1 for dose based
on body surface area (BSA). To manage adverse events (AEs), hepatic impairment,
or renal impairment, dose reductions may be needed based on BSA (Table 2).
IMT
For IMT, the recommended dose in adults is 250 mg BID until disease progression
or unacceptable toxicity.1 The dose in pediatric patients is 280 mg/m2 BID (Table
1).

NSCLC
For adults with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC, the recommended
dose of Xalkori is 250 mg BID until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.1
For adults who cannot swallow capsules, the recommended dose is 250 mg BID
using 2 x 50 mg pellets and 1 x 150 mg pellet per dose. To manage AEs, hepatic
impairment, renal impairment, or drug interactions, dose reductions to 200 mg BID
or 250 mg once daily (QD) may be needed.
Availability/Administration
Xalkori is available as 200 mg and 250 mg capsules in bottles containing 60
capsules each.1 Xalkori capsules should be swallowed whole.
Xalkori is also available as 20 mg, 50 mg, and 150 mg oral pellets, supplied in
bottles of 60 pellets each.1 Xalkori pellets should not be chewed or crushed. The
pellets are supplied encapsulated in shells but should not be swallowed in the shell.
The shell may be opened and the contents emptied directly into the patient’s
mouth. Alternatively, the shell may be opened and emptied into an oral dosing aid
(e.g., spoon, medicine cup) and then administered into the patient’s mouth via the
aid. A sufficient amount of water should be given to ensure that all medication is
swallowed immediately following administration of the Xalkori pellets.
