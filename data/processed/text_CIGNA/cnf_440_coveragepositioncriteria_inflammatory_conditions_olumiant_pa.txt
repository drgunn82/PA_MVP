I NSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR
PLAN DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE
BASED. FOR EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC
ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES
THE INFORMATION IN THE COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE,
BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS
IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON
THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING
COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED
ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE
DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON
SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES, REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR
PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE
NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY (SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE
MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT
ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE
POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED
VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Olumiant, an inhibitor of the Janus kinases (JAK) pathways, is indicated for the following
uses:1
• Alopecia Areata, in adults with severe disease.
• Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), for hospitalized adults requiring
supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). For COVID-19, the dose is 4 mg
once daily for 14 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. Of note, this
policy does not target this indication.
• Rheumatoid Arthritis, in adults with moderate to severe active disease have had
an inadequate response to one or more tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. Olumiant is
not recommended for use in combination with other JAK inhibitors, or in combination
with biologics or potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine or cyclosporine.
Guidelines
Olumiant is addressed in the following guidelines:
Page 1 of 8 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Olumiant Prior
Authorization Policy
• Alopecia Areata: An international expert opinion on treatments for alopecia areata
(2020) lists JAK inhibitors among the therapies for treatment of extensive hair loss.
First-line treatments for adults include high- or super-high potency topical
corticosteroids and/or systemic corticosteroids. Steroid-sparing therapies to mitigate
the risk associated with prolonged use of corticosteroids include cyclosporine,
methotrexate, and azathioprine.
• COVID-19: The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has developed
treatment guidelines for the management of COVID-19 and address the use of
Olumiant.3 Olumiant is recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 for a
duration of 14 days or until discharge from the hospital.
• Rheumatoid Arthritis: Guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology
(2021) recommend addition of a biologic or a targeted synthetic disease-modifying
antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for a patient taking the maximum tolerated dose of
methotrexate who is not at target.2
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Olumiant. The
intent of this policy is to provide recommendations for appropriate uses; the acute
treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients is not addressed in this policy. All approvals
are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is authorized in
months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills required for
evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Olumiant as well as the monitoring
required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval for certain indications
requires Olumiant to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated.
• Olumiant® (baricitinib tablets – Lilly)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for
FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indications
1. Alopecia Areata. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of the
following (A or B):
Note: Alopecia universalis and alopecia totalis are subtypes of alopecia areata.
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets ALL of the following (i, ii,
iii, iv, and v):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Patient has a current episode of alopecia areata lasting for ≥ 6 months; AND
iii. Patient has ≥ 50% scalp hair loss; AND
iv. Patient has tried at least ONE of the following for alopecia areata (a or b):

Policy
ii. Patient has been established on the requested drug for at least 6 months; AND
Note: A patient who has received < 6 months of therapy or who is restarting
therapy with the requested drug is reviewed under criterion A (Initial Therapy).
iii. Patient experienced a beneficial clinical response, defined as improvement from
baseline (prior to initiating Olumiant) in extent and density of scalp hair loss;
AND
iv. According to the prescriber, the patient continues to require systemic therapy for
treatment of alopecia areata.
Note: International consensus states that systemic treatment is best
discontinued once complete regrowth has been achieved and maintained for 6
months or when regrowth is sufficient to be managed topically.
2. Rheumatoid Arthritis. Approve for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of the
following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets ALL of the following (i, ii,
and iii):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):
a) Patient has had a 3-month trial of at least ONE tumor necrosis factor
inhibitor; OR
b) Patient has tried at least one tumor necrosis factor inhibitor but was unable to
tolerate a 3-month trial; AND
Note: Refer to Appendix for examples of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors used
for rheumatoid arthritis. Conventional synthetic disease-modifying
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, leflunomide,
hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine do not count.
iii. The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a rheumatologist; OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Olumiant. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
BOTH of the following (i and ii):
i. Patient has been established on the requested drug for at least 6 months; AND
Note: A patient who has received < 6 months of therapy or who is restarting
therapy with the requested drug is reviewed under criterion A (Initial Therapy).
ii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):
a) Patient experienced a beneficial clinical response when assessed by at least
one objective measure; OR
Note: Examples of standardized and validated objective measures of disease
activity include Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Disease Activity Score
(DAS) 28 using erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein
(CRP), Patient Activity Scale (PAS)-II, Rapid Assessment of Patient Index
Data 3 (RAPID-3), and/or Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI).
b) Patient experienced an improvement in at least one symptom, such as
decreased joint pain, morning stiffness, or fatigue; improved function or
activities of daily living; decreased soft tissue swelling in joints or tendon
sheaths.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Olumiant® (baricitinib tablets – Lilly)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including the
following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as newly
published data are available):
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Inflammatory Conditions – Olumiant Prior Authorization
Policy
1. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is generally
not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and lack of
controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic DMARDs (e.g.,
methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) in combination with
this medication.
2. Concurrent Use with a Biologic Immunomodulator. Olumiant is not recommended
in combination with biologic immunomodulators.1
Note: Examples include Adbry (tralokinumab-ldrm subcutaneous injection), Cinqair
(reslizumab intravenous), Dupixent (dupilumab subcutaneous injection), Ebglyss
(lebrikizumab-lbkz subcutaneous injection), Nemluvio (nemolizumab-ilto subcutaneous
injection), Fasenra (benralizumab subcutaneous injection), Nucala (mepolizumab
subcutaneous injection), Tezspire (tezepelumab-ekko subcutaneous injection), and
Xolair (omalizumab subcutaneous injection).
3. Concurrent Use with Topical Janus Kinase Inhibitors (JAKis). Olumiant should not
be administered in combination with a topical JAKi [e.g., Opzelura (ruxolitinib) cream)]
used for Atopic Dermatitis. Combination therapy is generally not recommended due to
the potential for a higher rate of adverse effects and lack of evidence for additive
efficacy.
4. Concurrent use with Other Potent Immunosuppressants (e.g., azathioprine,
cyclosporine).1 Co-administration with other potent immunosuppressive drugs has the
risk of added immunosuppression and has not been evaluated in rheumatoid arthritis.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of Olumiant with methotrexate; Olumiant has
been evaluated with background methotrexate or in combinations with conventional
synthetic DMARDs containing methotrexate.
5. COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019). Olumiant is only indicated in hospitalized
adults with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive
mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).1 For COVID-
19, the dose is 4 mg once daily for 14 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes
first.
6. Coverage is not recommended for circumstances not listed in the Recommended
Authorization Criteria. Criteria will be updated as newly published data are available.
