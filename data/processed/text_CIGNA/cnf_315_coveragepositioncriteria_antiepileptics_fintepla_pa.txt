INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT

COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Fintepla, a serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 2 (5-HT ) agonist, is indicated in
2
patients ≥ 2 years of age for the treatment of seizures associated with:1.
• Dravet syndrome.
• Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
Disease Overview
Dravet syndrome is a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy (dysfunction of the brain)
marked with frequent and/or prolonged seizures.2,3 It is estimated that 1 out of
15,700 infants born in the US are affected with Dravet syndrome. The seizures
generally begin in the first year of life in an otherwise healthy infant. Affected
individuals can develop many seizure types: myoclonic, tonic-clonic, absence,
atypical absence, atonic, focal aware or impaired awareness (previously called partial
seizures), and status epilepticus.3 As the seizures continue, most of the children

Authorization Policy
develop some level of developmental disability and other conditions associated with
the syndrome. Two or more antiseizure medications (ASMs) are often needed to
control the seizures; most of the seizures are refractory to medications. The goals of
treatment are cessation of prolonged convulsions, reductions in overall seizure
frequency, and minimization of treatment side effects.4,5 Some patients respond to
the ketogenic diet and/or vagus nerve stimulation.
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe epileptic and developmental encephalopathy, is
associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality.6,7 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome
most often begins between 3 and 5 years of age.6-9 Affected children experience
several different types of seizures, most commonly atonic seizures (sudden loss of
muscle tone and limpness) and tonic seizures.6,9 The three main forms of treatment
of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are ASMs, dietary therapy (typically the ketogenic diet),
and device/surgery (e.g., vagus nerve stimulation, corpus callostomy).9 None of the
therapies are effective in all cases of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and the disorder has
proven particularly resistant to most therapeutic options.
Guidelines
Dravet Syndrome
At this time, there are three drugs approved for the treatment of seizures associated
with Dravet syndrome: Diacomit® (stiripentol capsules, powder for oral suspension),
Epidiolex® (cannabidiol oral solution), and Fintepla.1,10 An expert panel considers
valproic acid to be the first-line treatment for Dravet syndrome.4 Clobazam,
Diacomit, and Fintepla can be considered as either first- or second-line ASMs.
Cannabidiol was supported either as first‐ or second‐line treatment. There was
modest consensus among caregivers, but no consensus among physicians to support
topiramate as first‐, second‐, or third‐line therapy. The Dravet Foundation states that
Diacomit, Epidiolex, and Fintepla are considered first-line agents for the treatment of
Dravet syndrome.2 If control is still inadequate, other therapies to consider are
clonazepam, levetiracetam, and zonisamide.2,4 Sodium channel blockers (e.g.,
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin) can worsen seizures in
Dravet syndrome. Additionally, vigabatrin and tiagabine may increase the frequency
of myoclonic seizures and should be avoided.
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
Currently, the FDA-approved drugs for this condition are Fintepla, clobazam,
clonazepam, rufinamide, Epidiolex, felbamate, lamotrigine, and topiramate.8 To
address the lack of treatment algorithm, the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome Special
Interest Group of the Pediatric Epilepsy Research Consortium (PERC) formed a core
working group focused on ASM selection in this patient population (2025). Despite
the lack of specific FDA labeling for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, valproic acid remains
a mainstay in treatment.8,9 Valproic acid is considered a first-line pharmacological
therapy but should be avoided in women of childbearing potential due to potential
teratogenic effects.8 Clobazam is recommended as a first-line option, particularly for
managing disabling drop seizures, while it may be considered a second-line option in
other cases. Cannabidiol may be considered a second-line therapy, specifically when
combined with clobazam; otherwise, it is generally listed as a third-line treatment.

Authorization Policy
Lamotrigine is considered a second-line therapy when used alongside valproate to
enhance therapeutic synergy or in patients at risk of cognitive and behavioral side
effects; otherwise, it can be utilized as a third- or fourth-line therapy depending on
individual patient profiles. Rufinamide is a second-line option, particularly in cases
where valproate or clobazam must be avoided, though it may be used as a third- or
fourth-line option if these medications are tolerated. Topiramate can be considered
from second- to fourth-line therapy, depending on the patient’s cognitive profile, as
well as the suitability and availability of other ASMs. Additional later-line options
include levetiracetam, brivaracetam, Fycompa® (perampanel tablet, oral
suspension), zonisamide, fenfluramine, and felbamate. In managing Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome, monotherapy is rarely effective, which necessitates the use of combination
therapy with two or three ASMs with varying mechanisms of action. However, where
possible, no more than two ASMs should be used concomitantly; use of multiple ASMs
raise the risk of side effects and/or drug-drug interactions. In addition to
pharmacological options, non-pharmacological therapies offer significant benefits in
managing Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and include neuromodulation, resective
surgery, corpus callosotomy, and the ketogenic diet.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Fintepla. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Fintepla as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Fintepla to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
