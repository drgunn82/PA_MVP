CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Juxtapid, a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor, is indicated as an
adjunct to a low fat diet and other lipid-lowering treatments, including low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis where available, to reduce low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and non-high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) in adults with homozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).1 Limitations of use include that the safety and
efficacy of Juxtapid have not been established in patients with hypercholesterolemia
who do not have HoFH, including those with heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). Also, the effect of Juxtapid on cardiovascular (CV)
morbidity and mortality have not been determined.
Repatha® (evolocumab subcutaneous injection) and Praluent® (alirocumab
subcutaneous injection), two proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9)
inhibitors, are indicated as an adjunct to diet and other LDL-lowering therapies
(e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with HoFH who require
additional LDL-C lowering.2,3 It is notable that patients known to have two LDL-
receptor negative alleles (little or no residual function) did not respond or had
minimal response to these agents. PCSK9 inhibitors are well tolerated and are not

associated with hepatotoxicity.2 Simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin are
statins that are indicated for the management of patients with HoFH.4-6 Ezetimibe
is also indicated for use in combination with atorvastatin or simvastatin in patients
with HoFH.7 Ezetimibe/simvastatin tablets are indicated for use in HoFH.8
Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb intravenous infusion), an angiopoietin-like 3 inhibitor,
is also indicated as an adjunct to other LDL-C lowering therapies for the treatment
of HoFH in patients ≥ 5 years of age.9
Disease Overview
Familial hypercholesterolemias, which includes HeFH and HoFH, encompasses a
group of genetic defects that causes severe elevations in LDL-C levels, as well as
other lipid parameters.10,11 HoFH impacts approximately 1 in 300,000 to 1,000,000
persons. The condition is most commonly due to impaired functionality of the LDL
receptor which leads to a low or absence of clearance of LDL-C from the circulation.
Currently known causes of familial hypercholesterolemia include mutations in the
LDL receptor, apolipoprotein B, or PCSK9 genes. Patients with familial
hypercholesterolemia may have physical findings such as tendon or cutaneous
xanthomas, which may occur in childhood. Individuals with familial
hypercholesterolemia are at very high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD) at a premature age. Most guidelines recommended LDL-C targets of <
100 mg/dL for adults and < 70 mg/dL for adults with ASCVD or other risk factors.
Statins are the initial treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia. For patients with
HoFH, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended, with ezetimibe added as well.
Therapy with a PCSK9 inhibitor (e.g., Repatha, Praluent) is usually the next step.
Juxtapid can be added onto maximal lipid-lowering therapy and Evkeeza®
(evinacumab-dgnb intravenous infusion) may be considered. Combination therapy
is required for most patients. LDL apheresis is recommended in certain
circumstances. The diagnosis of HoFH can be done by genetic or clinical criteria.10
An untreated LDL-C > 400 mg/dL is suggestive of HoFH. Patients may have
cutaneous or tendon xanthomas before 10 years of age and/or untreated elevated
LDL-C levels consistent with HeFH in both parents. In the digenic form, one parent
may have normal LDL-C levels and the other may have LDL-C levels consistent with
HoFH.
Guidelines
• American College of Cardiology Expert Consensus Decision Pathway
on the Role of Non-statin Therapies (2022): Specialized therapies, one
of which includes Juxtapid, may be needed to control LDL-C in certain
patients (e.g., those with HoFH) who have had an inadequate response to
statins, with or without ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors.12
• European Atherosclerosis Society (2023): Clinical guidance by this
organization recommends lipid-lowering therapy be initiated with high-
intensity statin therapy and ezetimibe.11 A PCSK9 inhibitor can be added as
well. If patients are not at LDL-C goals, other agents can be alternatives as
well (e.g., Juxtapid, Evkeeza). Lipoprotein apheresis may also be
considered. The goal is to reduce LDL-C to < 115 mg/dL in children and
adolescents, < 70 mg/dL in adults if no major ASCVD risk factors are

Prior Authorization Policy
present, and < 55 mg/dL if patients have ASCVD or major ASCVD risk
factors.
Safety
Juxtapid has a Boxed Warning regarding the risk of hepatotoxicity.1 Juxtapid may
cause elevations in liver transaminases. Also, Juxtapid increases hepatic fat
(hepatic steatosis) with or without concomitant increases in transaminases. Due to
the risk of hepatotoxicity, Juxtapid is available only through a Risk Mitigation and
Strategy Program. Juxtapid is a Pregnancy Category X medication and may cause
fetal harm when given to a pregnant woman based on findings suggesting
teratogenicity in animals. Females of reproductive potential should obtain a
negative pregnancy test before Juxtapid initiation and should utilize effective
contraception during Juxtapid use. Juxtapid is associated with gastrointestinal (GI)
adverse events (AEs), which occurred in 93% of patients (n = 27/29). GI AEs
included diarrhea (79%), nausea (65%), dyspepsia (38%), vomiting (34%), and
abdominal pain (34%). Postmarketing reports regarding severe diarrhea have been
associated with use of Juxtapid which have involved hospitalization of patients due
to diarrhea-related complications such as volume depletion.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Juxtapid. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. A patient who has previously
met Initial Therapy criteria for Juxtapid for the requested indication under the
Coverage Review Department and is currently receiving Juxtapid is only required to
meet continuation of therapy criteria (i.e., currently receiving therapy). If past
criteria has not been met under the Coverage Review Department and the patient is
currently receiving Juxtapid, or is restarting Juxtapid, Initial Therapy criteria must be
met.

HISTORY
Type of Summary of Changes Review
Revision Date
Annual It was added to the Policy Statement that a patient who has 04/26/2023
Revision previously met initial therapy criteria for Juxtapid for the requested
indication under the Coverage Review Department and is currently
receiving Juxtapid is only required to meet continuation of therapy
criteria (i.e., currently receiving therapy). If past criteria has not
been met under the Coverage Review Department and the patient is
currently receiving Juxtapid, or is restarting Juxtapid, initial criteria
must be met. In addition, the following change was made:
7 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia – Juxtapid
Prior Authorization Policy
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: Requirements
were divided to distinguish between initial therapy and patient
currently receiving Juxtapid (previously there was only one criteria
set). For a patient who is currently receiving Juxtapid and has
previously met initial therapy criteria for the requested indication
under the Coverage Review Department, only the continuation of
therapy criteria has to be met, which was newly developed. The
continuation of therapy criteria states that according to the
prescribing physician, the patient has experienced a response to
therapy with examples provided in a Note.
Annual Policy Statement: The statement that “the agent is prescribed by 05/08/2024
Revision or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition
being treated” was removed. In addition, the following changes
were made:
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia: For Initial
Therapy, the specialist physician requirement was removed. The
requirement that the patient has had genetic confirmation by two
mutant alleles at the low-density lipoprotein receptor, apolipoprotein
B, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9, or low-density
lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1 gene locus was changed to
state that the patient has phenotypic confirmation of homozygous
familial hypercholesterolemia and the above examples moved to a
Note. The diagnostic criterion which stated that the patient has an
untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level > 500 mg/dL was
changed to > 400 mg/dL. The criterion (which is in two places
[those with an untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level >
400 mg/dL and a treated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level ≥
300 mg/dL]) that both parents of the patient had untreated low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or total cholesterol levels
consistent with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia was
changed to state that at least one parent of the patient had
untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or total
cholesterol levels consistent with familial hypercholesterolemia. The
related Note that “An example of heterozygous familial
hypercholesterolemia in both parents would be if both had an
untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level ≥ 190 mg/dL
and/or an untreated total cholesterol level > 250 mg/dL” was
changed to state “An example of familial hypercholesterolemia is an
untreated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level ≥ 190 mg/dL
and/or an untreated total cholesterol level > 250 mg/dL.” For a
Patient Currently Receiving the Medication, the requirement that the
“prescribing physician” notes that the patient has experienced a
response to therapy was changed to “prescriber”.
