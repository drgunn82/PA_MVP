INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Zontivity, a protease-activated receptor-1 antagonist, is indicated for the reduction
of thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events in patients with a history of myocardial
infarction (MI) or with peripheral arterial disease (PAD).1 The agent has been
shown to reduce the rate of a combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, stroke,
and urgent coronary revascularization.
Studies involving Zontivity involved adding the agent to aspirin and/or clopidogrel.
Use Zontivity with aspirin and/or clopidogrel according to indicated uses or the
standard of care. The clinical use of Zontivity with other antiplatelet medications is
limited, as well as data involving Zontivity as the only antiplatelet agent. In a
subgroup analysis of the pivotal data, patients weighing < 60 kg who received
Zontivity did not have a favorable outcome regarding the primary composite endpoint
of CV death, MI, stroke, or urgent coronary revascularization.1,2
Guidelines
Various guidelines mention Zontivity:
• Chronic Coronary Disease: The guidelines for the management of patients
with chronic coronary disease (2023) from the American Heart Association
(AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC) address Zontivity.3 It is
Page 1 of 3 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Cardiology ( Zontivity Prior Authorization Policy
noted that in the TRAP 2P TIMI 50 trial, at a mean follow-up of 3 years, patients
with a history of MI, ischemic stroke, or PAD randomized to either Zontivity,
on a background of aspirin therapy, had a reduced number of ischemic events
or died from common from CV causes after 3 years compared with placebo.
However, patients experienced more major and intracranial bleeding.
• Peripheral Arterial Disease: Guidelines for the management of lower
extremity peripheral arterial disease from the AHA, ACC, and other
organizations state that in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial
disease, the benefit of adding Zontivity to existing antiplatelet therapy is
uncertain.4
Safety
Zontivity has a Boxed Warning regarding the risk of bleeding.1 Zontivity is
contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or
intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Antiplatelet medications, including Zontivity, increase
the risk of bleeding, including ICH and fatal bleeding.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Zontivity. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
• Zontivity® (vorapaxar tablets (Wraser)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Patient with a Previous Myocardial Infarction (MI) or Peripheral Arterial
Disease (PAD). Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of the following (A,
B, and C):
A) Patient weighs ≥ 60 kg; AND
B) Patient is receiving Zontivity in combination with aspirin and/or clopidogrel;
AND
C) Patient has been determined by the prescriber to be at high risk for future
thrombotic events.
Note: Examples of high risk include that the patient has experienced multiple
myocardial infarctions, has undergone many urgent coronary revascularization
procedures, has had placement of coronary artery stents, or the patient has
other concomitant diseases that increase cardiovascular risk such as diabetes.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Zontivity® (vorapaxar tablets (Wraser)
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Cardiology ( Zontivity Prior Authorization Policy
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) that Occurred Recently (within < 14
days). In the TRACER (Thrombin Receptor Antagonist for Clinical Event Reduction
in acute coronary syndrome) study, adding Zontivity to standard therapy in those
who experienced an ACS increased the risk of major bleeding and did not result
in clinical benefits.
2. Patient with a Prior History of Stroke, Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA),
or Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH). Zontivity is contraindicated for use in
patients with a history of stroke, TIA, or ICH due to an increased risk of ICH in
this population.
3. Concurrent Use of Effient (prasugrel tablets) or Brilinta (ticagrelor
tablets). There is limited clinical experience involving use of Zontivity with
antiplatelet agents (e.g., Effient, Brilinta) other than aspirin and/or clopidogrel.
