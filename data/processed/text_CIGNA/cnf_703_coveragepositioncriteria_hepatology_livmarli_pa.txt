INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Livmarli, an ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment
of:1
• Cholestatic pruritus in patients ≥ 3 months of age with Alagille syndrome
(ALGS).
• Cholestatic pruritus in patients > 12 months of age with progressive familial
intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC).
Disease Overview
ALGS is a rare liver disease defined by genetic deletion or genetic pathogenic variants
affecting bile acid transporters (e.g., deletion or variant of the JAG1 gene or NOTCH2
gene).2-4 PFIC is a group of rare, autosomal recessive liver diseases defined by
genetic pathogenic variants affecting bile acid transporters (e.g., variants of the
ATP8B1 gene, ABCB11 gene, ABCB4 gene, TJP2 gene, NR1H4 gene, or MYO5B

Authorization Policy
gene).5-7 Progression of both diseases can cause liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, or end-stage
liver disease and leads to death at an early age in life (infancy to adolescence).
Cholestasis, jaundice, and pruritus are common symptoms in patients with PFIC and
ALGS.2,5 Although the complete mechanism by which Livmarli improves pruritus in
these patients is unknown, it may involve inhibition of the IBAT, which results in
decreased reuptake of bile salts, as observed by a decrease in serum bile acids.1
Cholestyramine, rifampicin, and ursodeoxycholic acid (ursodiol) have been used off-
label for decades to alleviate symptoms related to PFIC and ALGS.7-9 Additionally,
cholestyramine, fenofibrate, ursodeoxycholic acid, rifampicin, naltrexone, and
sertraline are recommended in clinical practice guidelines from the European
Association for the Study of the Liver (2024).10
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Livmarli for ALGS was evaluated in one study that included an 18-
week open-label treatment period, followed by a 4-week randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled drug withdrawal period. 1 The study was conducted in 31 pediatric
patients with ALGS (1 year to 15 years of age) with cholestasis and pruritus. All
enrolled patients had a JAG1 genetic variant, elevated serum bile acid concentration,
and presence of at least moderate pruritus at baseline. Approximately 90.3% of
patients were receiving at least one medication to treat pruritus at study entry.
Patients treated with Livmarli demonstrated greater improvement in pruritus
compared to placebo. Safety and tolerability in infants less than 1 year of age was
assessed in a 13-week, open label, phase II study of 12 patients. Livmarli was well-
tolerated with treatment emergent adverse events, which were mostly Grade 1 and
unrelated to therapy.
The efficacy of Livmarli for PFIC was evaluated in one 26-week, randomized, placebo-
controlled pivotal trial.1 Efficacy was evaluated in 64 patients (12 months to 17 years
of age) with a clinical genetic confirmation of PFIC. Patients had to have an elevated
serum bile acid concentration along with presence of moderate to severe pruritus at
baseline. Most patients were on stable ursodeoxycholic acid (89.1%) or rifampicin
(51.6%) therapy at baseline. Patients treated with Livmarli demonstrated greater
improvement in pruritus compared with placebo.
Safety
Livmarli was not evaluated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.1 Monitor for
liver test abnormalities; permanently discontinue Livmarli if a patient progresses to
portal hypertension or experiences a hepatic decompensation event (e.g., variceal
hemorrhage, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy).
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Livmarli. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Livmarli as well as the
Page 2 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hepatology - Livmarli Prior
Authorization Policy
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Livmarli to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
