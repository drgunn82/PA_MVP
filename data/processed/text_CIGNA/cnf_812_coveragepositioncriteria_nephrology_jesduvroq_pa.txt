INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT

COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Jesduvroq, a hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor (HIF-PHI), is
indicated for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) in
adults who have been receiving dialysis for at least 4 months.1
Limitations of Use: Jesduvroq has not been shown to improve quality of life, fatigue,
or patient well-being.1 Jesduvroq is not indicated as a substitute for red blood cell
(RBC) transfusions in those who require immediate correction of anemia or for the
treatment of anemia due to CKD in patients who are not on dialysis.
It is recommended to evaluate the iron status in patients before and during Jesduvroq
therapy.1 Administer supplemental iron therapy when serum ferritin is < 100
mcg/mL or when serum transferrin saturation is < 20%. Most patients with CKD will
require supplemental iron during the course of therapy. Do not target a hemoglobin
Page 1 of 5: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Nephrology - Jesduvroq Prior
Authorization Policy
level higher than 11.0 g/dL. If the hemoglobin level exceeds 12.0 g/dL, interrupt
treatment with Jesduvroq. When the hemoglobin level is within the target range,
treatment may be restarted at a lower level. Treatment with Jesduvroq should not
be continued beyond 24 weeks of therapy if a clinically meaningful increase in
hemoglobin level is not achieved.
Note: The manufacturer announced they had notified the FDA that they had
withdrawn all strengths of Jesduvroq from the market for business reasons effective
December 19, 2024.4 According to the manufacturer, this voluntary action is not
related to the safety or efficacy of Jesduvroq.
Guidelines
The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines
for anemia in CKD (2025) provide recommendations for the use of HIF-PHIs.2 The
KDIGO guidelines recommend addressing all correctable causes of anemia (i.e. iron
deficiency, malignancy, infection, etc.) before initiating treatment with an
erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) or HIF-PHIs. After all correctable causes of
anemia are addressed, KDIGO suggests using ESAs as first-line therapy for treating
anemia in patients with CKD rather than HIF-PHIs. Although clinical trials have
revealed noninferiority of HIF-PHIs versus ESAs for efficacy as treatment for anemia,
some studies suggested a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events with
HIF-PHIs compared to ESAs in at least some CKD populations. HIF-PHI use should
be reserved for select patients where ESA use is contraindicated or not tolerated.
KDIGO indicates ESAs and HIF-PHIs should not be used concurrently. In patients
with CKD and anemia, treatment with HIF-PHIs should not be started and should be
suspended in those who experience cardiovascular/thromboembolic events or have
newly diagnosed cancer. KDIGO reference HIF-PHIs as a class and do not
differentiate recommendations between available products.
Safety
Jesduvroq has a Boxed Warning regarding an increased risk of death, myocardial
infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and thrombosis of vascular access.1
Targeting a hemoglobin level greater than 11.0 g/dL is expected to further increase
the risk of death and arterial venous thrombotic events, as occurs with ESAs, which
also increase erythropoietin levels. No trial has identified a hemoglobin target level,
dose of Jesduvroq, or dosing strategy that does not increase these risks. Use the
lowest dose of Jesduvroq sufficient to reduce the need for RBC transfusions. If the
hemoglobin level is > 12 g/dL, interrupt treatment with Jesduvroq. When the
hemoglobin level is within the target range, treatment may be restarted.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Jesduvroq.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval
is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Jesduvroq, as well
Page 2 of 5: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Nephrology - Jesduvroq Prior
Authorization Policy
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Jesduvroq to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Jesduvroq® (daprodustat tablets - GlaxoSmithKline)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Anemia in a Patient with Chronic Kidney Disease who is NOT on Dialysis.
Jesduvroq is not indicated for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney
disease in patients who are not on dialysis.1 The safety of Jesduvroq has not been
established for the treatment of anemia due to CKD in patients who are not on
dialysis. In a large cardiovascular outcomes trial in adults with anemia due to
CKD who were not on dialysis (ASCEND-ND), an increased risk of cardiovascular
mortality, stroke, thromboembolism, serious acute kidney injury, hospitalization
for heart failure, and serious gastrointestinal erosions was observed in patients
treated with Jesduvroq compared with erythropoietin-stimulating agent therapy.3
2. Anemia Associated with Cancer. Jesduvroq is not indicated for this use.1
3. Active Malignancy. Jesduvroq has not been studied and is not recommended in
patients with active malignancies. Increased hypoxia inducible factor-1 levels
may be associated with unfavorable effects on cancer growth.
4. Anemia due to Acute Blood Loss. Use of Jesduvroq is not appropriate in these
types of situations. Jesduvroq is not indicated for use as a substitute for
transfusion in patients requiring immediate correction of anemia.

5. Concurrent Use with Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents. Concurrent use is
not recommended.2
Note: Examples of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents include epoetin alfa products
(Procrit, Epogen, Retacrit intravenous or subcutaneous injection), Aranesp
(darbepoetin alfa intravenous or subcutaneous injection), and Mircera (methoxy
polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta intravenous or subcutaneous injection).
6. Concurrent Use with Vafseo (vadadustat tablets). The safety and efficacy
of concurrent use of Jesduvroq and Vafseo have not been established.
7. To Enhance Athletic Performance. Jesduvroq is not recommended for
approval because this indication is excluded from coverage in a typical pharmacy
benefit.
