INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Sovaldi, a hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleotide analog non-serine (NS)5B polymerase
inhibitor, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 infection, in adults without cirrhosis
or with compensated cirrhosis as a component of a combination antiviral
treatment.
• Chronic HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection, in pediatric patients ≥ 3 years of
age without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis in combination with
ribavirin.
Dosing
The recommended dose of Sovaldi in pediatric patients ≥ 3 years of age with
genotype 2 or 3 HCV is based on weight, and is to be taken orally once daily in
combination with ribavirin (Table 1).1 Sovaldi pellets can be taken by pediatric
patients who cannot swallow the tablet formulation.

Patient Population Treatment and Duration
Genotype 2 Treatment-naïve and treatment experienced Sovaldi + ribavirin x 12 weeks
without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis
(Child-Pugh A)
Genotype 3 Treatment-naïve and treatment experienced Sovaldi + ribavirin x 24 weeks
without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis
(Child-Pugh A)
Availability
Sovaldi is available as 150 mg and 200 mg pellets in unit-dose packets in cartons of
28 packets.1 Sovaldi is also available as 200 mg and 400 mg tablets in bottles
containing 28 tablets.
Guidelines
According to the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD)
guidelines, weight-based Sovaldi + ribavirin for treatment-naive or interferon-
experienced (± ribavirin) children aged ≥3 years with genotype 2 or 3, without
cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A) is no longer favored because
pangenotypic ribavirin-free treatments are now available for children as young as 3
years of age.2 The AASLD recommends Epclusa® (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir tablets
and oral pellets) and Mavyret® (glecaprevir/pibrentasvir tablets and oral pellets) for
the treatment of patients ≥ 3 years of age with genotypes 1 through 6 chronic HCV
who are treatment-naïve or interferon-experienced, with or without compensated
cirrhosis; Harvoni® (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir tablets and oral pellets) is also an option
for children ≥ 3 years of age with genotypes 1, 4, 5, or 6 chronic HCV.2
POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to prevent
stockpiling and waste and address potential order entry error of Sovaldi. If the
Drug Quantity Management rule is not met for the requested medication at the
point of service, coverage will be determined by the Criteria below. All approvals
