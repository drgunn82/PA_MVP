INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE

BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and combination products are
indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (as
monotherapy and as combination therapy) when used as adjuncts to diet and
exercise.1-11,15-17
Various combination products are available which combine DPP-4 inhibitors with
metformin, sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and/or
thiazolidinediones (TZDs). Of note, the SGLT-2/DPP-4 combination products are
not addressed in this policy; refer to the Diabetes – Sodium Glucose Co-
Transporter-2 and Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 Inhibitors Step Therapy Policy.
GUIDELINES
The American Diabetes Association Standards of Care (2025) note that therapy for
patients with type 2 diabetes depends on comorbidities, patient-centered treatment
factors.12 Metformin is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment
(estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) and in patients
with acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, with or
without coma.13 DPP-4 inhibitors are among the classes of medications
recommended as add-on therapy after metformin; however, they have lower
glycemic efficacy than other classes and lack cardiorenal indications. Because type
2 diabetes is often a progressive disease, combination therapy may be needed for
many patients over time to achieve glycemic targets.
POLICY STATEMENT
This program has been developed to encourage the use of a Step 1 Product prior to
the use of a Step 2 Product. If the Step Therapy rule is not met for a Step 2
Product at the point of service, coverage will be determined by the Step Therapy
criteria below. All approvals are provided for 1 year in duration.
• One Step 1 Product; OR
• One of the following metformin-containing products: Glumetza ER, Riomet,
metformin oral solution, metformin extended-release (generics to Fortamet
ER and Glumetza ER), glyburide/metformin, glipizide/metformin, Actoplus
Met, pioglitazone/metformin, Invokamet, Invokamet XR, Synjardy, Synjardy
XR, Xigduo XR, dapagliflozin/metformin extended-release, Segluromet; OR
• One Step 2 Product.
