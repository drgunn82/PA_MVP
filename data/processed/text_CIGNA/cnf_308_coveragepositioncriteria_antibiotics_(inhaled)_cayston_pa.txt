INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Cayston, a monobactam antibiotic, is indicated to improve respiratory symptoms in
cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.1 Safety and efficacy
have not been established in pediatric patients < 7 years of age, in patients with
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) < 25% or > 75% predicted, or in patients
1
colonized with Burkholderia cepacia.
To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness
of Cayston and other antibiotics, Cayston should be used to treat patients with CF
known to have P. aeruginosa in the lungs.1
Clinical Efficacy
An open-label study assessed inhaled aztreonam for the eradication of newly acquired
P. aeruginosa in children aged 3 months to < 18 years of age (n = 105).2 In total,
49 patients < 6 years of age were included in the study. Patients received inhaled
aztreonam 75 mg three times daily for 28 days. At the end of treatment with inhaled
aztreonam, 91.5% of the patients (n = 43/47) < 6 years of age were culture-negative
for P. aeruginosa and 76.6% of patients (n = 36/47) < 6 years of age remained
culture-negative 4 weeks after completing the course of therapy.

Guidelines
The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Pulmonary Therapeutics Committee provides
recommendations for the use of chronic medications in the management of CF lung
disease (2013).3 In patients ≥ 6 years of age with CF and moderate-to-severe lung
disease with P. aeruginosa persistently present in cultures of the airways, chronic use
of inhaled aztreonam is strongly recommended to improve lung function and quality
of life (QoL). For mild disease, the Committee recommends chronic use of inhaled
aztreonam for patients ≥ 6 years of age with CF and P. aeruginosa persistently
present in cultures of the airways, to improve lung function and QoL.
The CFF published a systematic review of the literature regarding eradication of initial
P. aeruginosa infections to develop guidelines for effective prevention (2014).4 The
recommendations pertaining to inhaled antibiotics are as follows: 1) Inhaled
antibiotic therapy is recommended for the treatment of initial or new growth of P.
aeruginosa (the favored antibiotic regimen is tobramycin [300 mg twice daily ] for
28 days); and 2) Prophylactic antipseudomonal antibiotics to prevent the acquisition
of P. aeruginosa are not recommended.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Cayston. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Cayston as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Cayston to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
