INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Byetta and Bydureon BCise are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists.1,2
Byetta is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control
in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.1
Bydureon BCise is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve
glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 10 years of age with type 2
diabetes mellitus.2
Dosing
The recommended dose of Byetta is 5 mcg administered subcutaneous (SC) twice
daily (BID) within 60 minutes prior to the morning and evening meals (or the two
main meals of the day, approximately ≥ 6 hours apart). The dose of Byetta may be
increased to 10 mcg BID after 1 month of therapy if needed, based on clinical
response. If a dose is missed, resume the treatment regimen as prescribed with
the next scheduled dose.
Page 1 of 3 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Diabetes – Exenatide Products Drug Quantity
Management Policy – Per Days
The recommended dose of Bydureon BCise is 2 mg SC once weekly (QW) [every 7
days].2 The dose may be administered with or without meals, at any time of day.
Patients switching from another extended-release exenatide product should
discontinue that product and then initiate Bydureon BCise at the next regularly
scheduled dose. Patients switching from immediate-release exenatide may
experience transient blood glucose elevations (approximately 2 to 4 weeks). A
patient may change the day of weekly administration, as long as the previous dose
was administered ≥ 3 days before the new administration day. If a dose is missed,
it can be administered as soon as it is noticed if the next schedule dose is due at
least 3 days later. If the next regularly scheduled dose is due 1 or 2 days later,
skip the missed dose and resume Bydureon BCise with the next regularly scheduled
dose.
