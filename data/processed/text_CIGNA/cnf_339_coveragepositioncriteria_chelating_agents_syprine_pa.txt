INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Trientine products (capsules [Syprine, generic] and tablets [Cuvrior]) are chelating
agents indicated for the treatment of Wilson’s disease (hepatolenticular
degeneration).1,2
Syprine (trientine hydrochloride capsules, generic) is indicated for:1
• Treatment of patients with Wilson’s disease who are intolerant of
penicillamine.
Cuvrior (trientine tetrahydrochloride tablets) is indicated for:2
• Treatment of adults with stable Wilson’s disease who are de-coppered and
tolerant to penicillamine.
Trientine is not indicated for use in patients with cystinuria, rheumatoid arthritis, or
biliary cirrhosis.1 Trientine products should be used when treatment with
penicillamine is no longer possible because of intolerable or life-endangering side
effects.1 The content of trientine differs between products, thus they are not
interchangeable on a mg per mg basis.2

Disease Overview
Wilson’s disease is an autosomal recessive disorder in which alterations in cellular
copper processing and impaired biliary excretion lead to copper accumulation.3-5
Copper initially builds up in the liver and is eventually released into the bloodstream
and deposited into other organs (e.g., brain, kidneys, and cornea) so it can cause a
wide array of symptoms. Lifelong pharmacologic therapy is the mainstay of treatment
for Wilson’s disease; without treatment, most patients will die from liver disease or
progressive neurologic disease. Liver transplantation is reserved for severe or
resistant cases. In patients with Wilson’s disease, trientine acts as a general metal
chelator and promotes urinary copper excretion as well as blocks dietary copper
absorption.
Guidelines
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) provides guidelines
for the diagnosis and management of Wilson’s disease (2022).4 Diagnosis of Wilson’s
disease is confirmed by conducting genetic testing confirming biallelic pathogenic
ATP7B mutations or confirmation of at least two clinical features associated with
Wilson’s disease (Kayser-Fleischer rings, serum ceruloplasmin level < 20 mg/dL, liver
biopsy, 24-hour urinary copper > 40 mcg/24 hours). The AASLD recommends a
chelating agent (penicillamine or trientine) for initial treatment of symptomatic
patients. For the treatment of presymptomatic patients or those on maintenance
therapy, chelating agents and zinc are both treatment options.
The European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) also published a clinical
practice guideline for the treatment of Wilson’s disease (2012).5 Like the AASLD, the
EASL acknowledges that numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of
penicillamine. A chelating agent (penicillamine or trientine) is the recommended
initial treatment of symptomatic patients, and a chelating agent or zinc may be used
for the treatment of presymptomatic patients or patients established on maintenance
therapy. In patients with neurological disease established on maintenance therapy,
either a chelating agent or zinc may be used; zinc may have a role as first-line
therapy in these patients. If zinc is used, careful monitoring of transaminases is
needed, with changing to chelators if these laboratory parameters are increasing.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of trientine
products. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
trientine as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy,
approval requires trientine products to be prescribed by or in consultation with a
physician who specializes in the condition being treated.

Policy
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Wilson’s Disease. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL of the following
(A, B, and C):
A) Diagnosis of Wilson’s disease is confirmed by ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Genetic testing results confirming biallelic pathogenic ATP7B mutations (in
either symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals); OR
ii. Confirmation of at least TWO of the following (TWO of a, b, c, or d):
a) Presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings; OR
b) Serum ceruloplasmin level < 20 mg/dL; OR
c) Liver biopsy findings consistent with Wilson’s disease; OR
d) 24-hour urinary copper > 40 mcg/24 hours; AND
B) Patient meets ONE of the following (i, ii, iii, iv, v or vi):
i. According to the prescriber, patient has tried one penicillamine product and
is intolerant to penicillamine therapy; OR
Note: Examples of penicillamine products are Cuprimine (penicillamine
capsules, generic) Depen (penicillamine tablets, generic).
ii. According to the prescriber, patient has clinical features indicating the
potential for intolerance to penicillamine therapy; OR
Note: Specific clinical features include history of any renal disease,
congestive splenomegaly causing severe thrombocytopenia, autoimmune
tendency.
iii. According to the prescriber, patient has a contraindication to penicillamine
therapy; OR
iv. Patient has neurologic manifestations of Wilson’s disease; OR
v. Patient is pregnant; OR
vi. Patient has been started on therapy with trientine (Cuvrior or Syprine,
generic).
C) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a gastroenterologist,
hepatologist, or liver transplant physician.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Cuvrior™ (trientine tetrahydrochloride tablets – Orphalan)
• Syprine® (trientine hydrochloride capsules – Bausch, generic)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Biliary Cirrhosis. Trientine is not indicated for the treatment of biliary cirrhosis.1
4 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Chelating Agents – Trientine Products Prior Authorization
Policy
2. Cystinuria. Trientine is not recommended for use in patients with cystinuria.1
Unlike penicillamine, trientine does not contain a sulfhydryl moiety and therefore
it is not capable of binding cysteine.
3. Rheumatoid Arthritis. Trientine is not recommended for use in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis.1 Per the prescribing information, trientine was not found to
be effective in improving any clinical or biochemical parameter after 12 weeks of
treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
