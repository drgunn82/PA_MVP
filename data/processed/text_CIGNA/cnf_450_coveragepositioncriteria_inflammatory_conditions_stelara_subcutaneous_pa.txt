Products Prior Authorization Policy with Dosing
OVERVIEW
Ustekinumab subcutaneous (SC), an interleukin (IL)-12/23 blocker, is indicated for
the following uses:1,8-14
• Crohn’s disease, in patients ≥ 18 years of age with moderate to severe active
disease.
• Plaque psoriasis, in patients ≥ 6 years of age with moderate to severe
disease who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy.
• Psoriatic arthritis, in patients ≥ 6 years of age with active disease.
• Ulcerative colitis, in patients ≥ 18 years of age with moderate to severe
active disease.
Dosing
A weight-based dose is administered by SC injection under the supervision of a
physician or by the patient or a caregiver. The approved dosing listed in the
prescribing information are as follows:1,8-14
• Crohn’s disease: Starting 8 weeks after an initial intravenous (IV) dose, the
maintenance dose is 90 mg SC injection once every 8 weeks (Q8W).
• Plaque psoriasis:
o Adults weighing ≤ 100 kg: 45 mg SC at Week 0, Week 4, and then once
every 12 weeks (Q12W) thereafter.
o Adults weighing > 100 kg: 90 mg SC at Week 0, Week 4, and then Q12W
thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age weighing < 60 kg: 0.75 mg/kg SC at
Week 0, Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age weighing 60 kg to 100 kg: 45 mg SC at
Week 0, Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age weighing > 100 kg: 90 mg SC at Week
0, Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
• Psoriatic arthritis:
o Adults weighing > 100 kg with co-existent moderate to severe plaque
psoriasis: 90 mg SC at Week 0, Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
o All other adults: 45 mg SC at Week 0, Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age weighing < 60 kg: 0.75 mg/kg SC at
Week 0, Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age weighing 60 kg to 100 kg: 45 mg SC at
Week 0, Week 4, and then Q12W thereafter.
o Pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age weighing > 100 kg with co-existent
moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: 90 mg SC at Week 0, Week 4, and
then Q12W thereafter.
• Ulcerative colitis: Starting 8 weeks after an initial IV dose, the maintenance
dose is 90 mg SC Q8W.
Guidelines
Guidelines for the treatment of inflammatory conditions recommend use of
ustekinumab SC.
• Crohn’s Disease: The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) [2025]
has guidelines for the management of Crohn’s disease in adults.2 In moderate
to severe disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies may be
12 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Ustekinumab Subcutaneous
Products Prior Authorization Policy with Dosing
utilized for induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended include
tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), Entyvio® (vedolizumab), IL-23
inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors, and Rinvoq® (upadacitinib). If steroids are
utilized for induction, efforts should be made to introduce steroid-sparing
agents for maintenance therapy. Guidelines from the American
Gastroenterological Association (AGA) [2021] include various biologics among
the therapies for moderate to severe Crohn’s disease, for induction and
maintenance of remission.15
• Plaque Psoriasis: Guidelines from the American Academy of Dermatology
and National Psoriasis Foundation (2019) recommend ustekinumab as a
monotherapy treatment option or in combination with other therapies for
adults with moderate to severe disease.3
• Psoriatic Arthritis: Guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology
(2018) recommend ustekinumab after other agents (e.g., TNFis) have been
tried.4 Ustekinumab may be used in patients who have active disease despite
treatment with other agents, particularly in those with concomitant
inflammatory bowel disease.4
• Ulcerative Colitis: The AGA (2024) and the ACG (2025) have clinical practice
guidelines on the management of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.5,6 In
moderate to severe disease, systemic corticosteroids or advanced therapies
may be utilized for induction of remission. Advanced therapies recommended
include TNF inhibitors, Entyvio, IL-23 inhibitors, IL-12/23 inhibitors,
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators, and Janus kinase (JAK)
inhibitors. If steroids are utilized for induction, efforts should be made to
introduce steroid-sparing agents for maintenance therapy. Of note, guidelines
state corticosteroids may be avoided entirely when other effective induction
strategies are planned.6 Both guidelines also recommend that any drug that
effectively treats induction should be continued for maintenance.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of ustekinumab
SC. All approvals are provided for the duration listed below. In cases where the
approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
ustekinumab SC as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term
efficacy, initial approval requires ustekinumab SC to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.

12 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Ustekinumab Subcutaneous
Products Prior Authorization Policy with Dosing
1. Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). There are other biologic therapies indicated in AS.
More data are needed to demonstrate efficacy of ustekinumab in this condition.
There is a published proof-of-concept trial evaluating ustekinumab in AS (TOPAS
– UsTekinumab for the treatment Of Patients with active Ankylosing Spondylitis).4
TOPAS was a prospective, open-label study evaluating ustekinumab 90 mg
subcutaneous at Weeks 0, 4, and 16 in patients (n = 20) with AS. After Week 16,
patients were followed through Week 28. Patients who previously failed to respond
to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) were excluded. The primary endpoint was
a 40% improvement in disease activity at Week 24 according to the Assessment
of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria (ASAS40) in the intent-
to-treat population which included all patients who received at least one dose of
ustekinumab. In all, 65% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI]: 41%, 85%;
n = 13/20) achieved an ASAS40 response at Week 24. There was at least a 50%
improvement of the BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index)
achieved by 55% of patients (95% CI: 32%, 77%; n = 11/20). However,
enthesitis (measured by MASES [Maastricht AS Entheses Score] and SPARCC
[SPondyloArthritis Research Consortium of Canada] enthesitis indices) and the
number of swollen joints were not significantly improved at Week 24. There was
a significant reduction of active inflammation on magnetic resonance imaging at
Week 24 compared with baseline in sacroiliac joints.
2. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic disease modifying
antirheumatic drugs (e.g., methotrexate leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and
sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication.
