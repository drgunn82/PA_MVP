INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Mavenclad, a purine antimetabolite, is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms
of multiple sclerosis (MS), including relapsing remitting disease and active
secondary progressive disease, in adults.1 Due to its safety profile, use of Mavenclad
is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or
are unable to tolerate, an alternative drug for the treatment of MS.1 A Limitation of
Use is that Mavenclad is not recommended for use in patients with clinically isolated
syndrome because of its safety profile.
Disease Overview
MS is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating, autoimmune disease of the central
nervous system (CNS) that impacts almost 1,000,000 people in the US.2-4 The
condition is marked by inflammation and demyelination, as well as degenerative
alterations. Patients usually experience relapses and remissions in their neurological
Page 1 of 6: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Multiple Sclerosis (Oral – Other) –
Mavenclad Prior Authorization Policy
symptoms. For most patients, the onset of MS symptoms occurs when patients are
20 to 40 years of age; however, children can get MS and new onset disease can occur
in older adults. The MS disease course is heterogeneous but has some patterns.
Approximately 85% to 90% of patients have a relapsing pattern at onset. However,
this transitions over time in patients who are untreated to a worsening with very few
or no relapses or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity (secondary progressive
MS). Around 10% to 15% of patients have a steady progression of symptoms over
time (primary progressive MS), marked by some clinical manifestations or by MRI
activity. Primary progressive MS is generally diagnosed in patients on the upper level
of the typical age range (e.g., almost 40 years of age) and the distribution is
equivalent among the two genders.2-4 Advances in the understanding of the MS
disease process, as well as in MRI technology, spurned updated disease course
descriptions in 2013,5 as well as in 2017.6 The revised disease courses are clinically
isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting MS, primary progressive MS, and secondary
progressive MS.2-6 Clinically isolated syndrome is now more recognized among the
course descriptions of MS. It is the first clinical presentation of MS that displays
characteristics of inflammatory demyelination that may possibly be MS but has yet
to fulfill diagnostic criteria. It is notable that the other MS designations can be further
characterized considering whether patients have active (or not active) disease, as
well as if disease is worsening or stable. Disability in MS is commonly graded on the
deterioration of mobility per the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), an ordinal
scale that ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater disability.
Guidelines
In September 2019, a consensus paper was updated by the MS Coalition that
discusses the use of disease-modifying therapies in MS.2 Many options from various
disease classes, involving different mechanisms of action and modes of
administration, have shown benefits in patients with MS.
Safety
Mavenclad has a Boxed Warning regarding malignancies and the risk of
teratogenicity.1 Mavenclad may increase the risk of malignancy. Also, Mavenclad is
a cytotoxic drug. Special handling instructions and disposal procedures should be
followed. There are several contraindications associated with the use of Mavenclad,
including: patients with current malignancy; pregnant women, women and men of
reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception during
Mavenclad dosing and for 6 months after the last dose in each treatment course;
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); active chronic infection (e.g., hepatitis or
tuberculosis); history of hypersensitivity to cladribine; and women intending to
breastfeed on a treatment day in which Mavenclad is administered and for 10 days
after the last dose. Warnings and Precautions for Mavenclad include lymphopenia,
infections, hematologic toxicity, graft-versus-host disease with blood transfusion, and
liver injury.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Mavenclad.
All approvals are provided for the duration cited below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Mavenclad as well
Page 2 of 6: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Multiple Sclerosis (Oral – Other) –
Mavenclad Prior Authorization Policy
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Mavenclad to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
