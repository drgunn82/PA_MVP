CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Myalept, a recombinant analog of human leptin, is indicated as an adjunct to diet as
replacement therapy to treat complications of leptin deficiency in patients with congenital
or acquired generalized lipodystrophy.1
Limitations of Use: The safety and efficacy of Myalept have not been established for the
treatment of complications of partial lipodystrophy, liver disease (including nonalcoholic
steatophepatitis [NASH]), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related lipodystrophy, or
metabolic disease (including diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia) without concurrent
evidence of generalized lipodystrophy.
Congenital generalized lipodystrophy is an inherited autosomal recessive disease.21 AGPAT2
and BSCL2 gene mutations are responsible for 95% of currently identified cases, while
mutations of CAV1 and the PTRF gene have also been reported, although much less
frequently. Several patients with congenital generalized lipodystrophy do not have any of
the four known gene mutations, indicating that not all mutations associated with congenital
generalized lipodystrophy have been identified. Patients with this condition can experience
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Lipodystrophy – Myalept Prior Authorization Policy
a variety of complications, such as hyperinsulinemia, diabetes mellitus,
hypertriglyceridemia, pancreatitis, fatty liver, and loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue.
Guidelines
Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of lipodystrophy syndromes were published in
2016 and endorsed by multiple groups of endocrine experts, including the Endocrine
Society, the Pediatric Endocrine Society, the American Diabetes Association, and the
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.2 These guidelines note that lipodystrophy
is an incurable condition, and no treatment will regrow adipose tissue. Myalept is the only
drug specifically indicated for the treatment of lipodystrophy. Myalept, along with diet, is
recommended as the first-line treatment for metabolic and endocrine abnormalities in
patients with generalized lipodystrophy. In children, Myalept may also be used to prevent
the development of comorbidities.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Myalept. Because of
the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Myalept,
as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Myalept to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below.
• Myalept® (metreleptin subcutaneous injection – Chiesi)

a) Patient has had a genetic test demonstrating one gene mutation (i.e.,
AGPAT2, BSCL2, CAV1, or PTRF) confirming the diagnosis of congenital
generalized lipodystrophy; OR
b) Patient meets BOTH of the following (1 and 2):
(1)Patient has had a genetic test that did not demonstrate an AGPAT2,
BSCL2, CAV1, or PTRF gene mutation; AND
(2)A clinical diagnosis of congenital generalized lipodystrophy has been made
by a specialist with experience in treating patients with lipodystrophy; OR

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Myalept® (metreleptin subcutaneous injection – Chiesi)
2 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Lipodystrophy – Myalept Prior Authorization Policy
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including the
following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as newly
published data are available):
1. General Obesity not associated with Congenital Leptin Deficiency. Myalept is
contraindicated in patients with general obesity not associated with congenital leptin
deficiency.1 Myalept was previously evaluated in two clinical development programs for
obesity, both as monotherapy (n > 1,100) and in combination with Symlin® (pramlintide
acetate for injection; n > 600).3 Published studies on the effects of leptin therapy in
these patients without leptin deficiency yielded conflicting efficacy results.4,5 The
studies involving obese patients (some with type 2 diabetes mellitus), with the
exception of one dose-escalation trial, failed to show significant weight loss with Myalept
therapy and resulted in clinically insignificant changes in other metabolic parameters,
such as insulin sensitivity.6-10 One additional randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled crossover study evaluated the efficacy of leptin administration to promote
further weight reduction in patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
surgery.11 Following 16 weeks of therapy, Myalept was not found to promote additional
decreases in body weight compared with placebo.
2. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-related Lipodystrophy. Myalept is not
indicated for the treatment of patients with HIV-related lipodystrophy.1 Results from
four small studies of patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy and leptin deficiency
showed mixed results with Myalept therapy.12-15 One study found significantly improved
fasting insulin levels, insulin resistance and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, but no
significant differences in fasting glucose levels, free-fatty acid levels, or low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) levels when Myalept was compared with placebo.12 Another
demonstrated improved fasting insulin levels, but no difference in intravenous glucose
disappearance, fasting serum glucose concentration, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA )
1C
levels, body mass index (BMI), or lipid parameters after treatment with Myalept.13 Two
additional studies found that therapy with Myalept improved some, but not all metabolic
parameters in patients infected with HIV.14,15 More information is needed to determine if
Myalept is a safe and effective treatment for HIV-related lipodystrophy.
3. Partial Lipodystrophy. The safety and efficacy of Myalept in the treatment of the
complications of partial lipodystrophy have not been established.1 The effects of Myalept
therapy in patients with partial lipodystrophy have been evaluated; the pivotal trial of
Myalept included a subset of patients (n = 24) with partial lipodystrophy.16 Overall,
patients with partial lipodystrophy had milder baseline metabolic abnormalities than
patients with generalized lipodystrophy. Following 12 months of Myalept therapy,
patients experienced a reduction in HbA , fasting plasma glucose, and fasting
1C
triglycerides; however, the magnitude of the improvements was less than those
observed in patients with generalized lipodystrophy. There are data showing sustained
improvements out to 36 months as well.17 Additional data also highlight the
heterogeneity of partial lipodystrophy; Myalept may provide improvement in some
metabolic parameters in certain patients with partial lipodystrophy, but more data are
needed to confirm these benefits.18-20 Current lipodystrophy guidelines (2016) outline
certain patients with partial lipodystrophy that may benefit from Myalept therapy, but
indicate a lower level of evidence to support use in this patient population compared
with generalized lipodystrophy.2 Myalept prescribing information continues to list partial
lipodystrophy as a limitation of use.1

Early Annual Generalized Lipodystrophy (Congenital or Acquired): 06/14/2023
Revision Criteria were updated to require that the patient has one or more
manifestations of leptin deficiency and to require Myalept be used
in conjunction with dietary modification. The wording for the
criterion for specialists was updated from “geneticist physician
specialist” to “geneticist.” Criteria were also updated to require
that patients meet one of the following:
• Patient has congenital generalized lipodystrophy and must have
had a genetic test demonstrating one gene mutation (i.e.,
AGPAT2, BSCL2, CAV1, or PTRF) confirming the diagnosis of
congenital generalized lipodystrophy; OR have had a genetic test
that did not demonstrate an AGPAT2, BSCL2, CAV1, or PTRF
gene mutation and a clinical diagnosis of congenital generalized
lipodystrophy has been made by a specialist with experience in
treating patients with lipodystrophy.
• Patient has acquired generalized lipodystrophy.
