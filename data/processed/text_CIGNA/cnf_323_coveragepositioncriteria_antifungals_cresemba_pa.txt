INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Cresemba, an azole antifungal, is indicated in adults and pediatric patients ≥ 6
years of age who weigh ≥ 16 kg for the following uses:1
• Invasive aspergillosis.
• Invasive mucormycosis.
Cresemba is also available for use as an intravenous (IV) infusion.1 Switching
between the IV and oral formulation is acceptable as the two formulations are
bioequivalent. A loading dose is not required when switching between formulations.
Patients are typically transitioned from the IV formulation to the oral formulation
while in the hospital or upon discharge. In the pivotal study involving patients with
invasive aspergillosis, patients were initiated on IV Cresemba before transitioning to
oral Cresemba therapy. The mean treatment duration was 47 days, of which
patients received IV Cresemba for 8 to 9 days.

Policy
Guidelines/Recommendations
The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) [2016] recommends Cresemba
as a treatment option for invasive aspergillosis and different invasive syndromes of
Aspergillus (e.g., invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, invasive sinus aspergillosis,
aspergillosis of the central nervous system).2 Treatment of invasive aspergillosis
should be continued for a minimum of 6 to 12 weeks, depending on the degree and
duration of immunosuppression, site of disease, and evidence of disease
improvement.
The global guideline for the diagnosis and management of mucormycosis (2019)
recommends Cresemba as a treatment option with moderate strength. The duration
of therapy to treat mucormycosis is unknown, but in general weeks to month of
therapy are required.5 In an open-label, non-comparative study that included a
subset of patients with invasive mucormycosis, patients were treated with either IV
or oral Cresemba. The median duration of Cresemba therapy was 102 days for
patients classified as primary, 33 days for refractory, and 85 days for intolerant.1
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Prevention and
Treatment of Cancer-Related Infections (version 1.2025 – June 20, 2025) note that
use of Cresemba may be considered for patients who have invasive or refractory
aspergillosis or mucormycosis or who have intolerance to amphotericin B
formulations.3 NCCN also notes Cresemba as a treatment option for the prevention
of fungal infections in patients with significant graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
[especially grade 3/4] who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy; treatment
should continue until resolution of significant GVHD. Cresemba is also a treatment
option for these groups of patients with neutropenia: patients with myelodysplastic
syndrome, patients with acute myeloid leukemia, and patients who are allogeneic
hematopoietic cell transplant recipients; treatment should continue until resolution
of neutropenia.
The guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and
adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections (last updated April
2025) note Cresemba as a treatment option for patients with HIV and esophageal
candidiasis.4 Cresemba is also an option for patients with HIV and
coccidioidomycosis.
The global guideline for the diagnosis and management of cryptococcosis (2024)
note Cresemba as an alternative treatment option for patients with cryptococcal
meningitis.6 This is a moderate strength recommendation as Cresemba and other
triazole drugs have not been formally studied in cryptococcosis.
