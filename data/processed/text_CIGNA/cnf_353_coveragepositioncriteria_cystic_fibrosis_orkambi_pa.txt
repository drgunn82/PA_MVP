CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Orkambi, a combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor, is indicated for the treatment
of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients ≥ 1 year of age who are homozygous for the
F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR) gene.1
If the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared cystic fibrosis mutation test
should be used to detect the presence of the F508del mutation on both alleles of
the CFTR gene. The efficacy and safety of Orkambi have not been established in
patients with cystic fibrosis other than those homozygous for the F508del mutation.
Orkambi contains a unique chemical entity, lumacaftor, which is a CFTR corrector
that increases trafficking of F508del CFTR to the cell surface, and ivacaftor (the
same active ingredient contained in Kalydeco® [ivacaftor tablets and oral
granules]), a CFTR potentiator that enhances chloride transport of CFTR on the cell

– Orkambi Prior Authorization Policy
surface. The F508del mutation in CFTR causes cystic fibrosis by limiting the amount
of CFTR protein that reaches the epithelial cell surface.
Guidelines
The most current treatment recommendations are the Standards of Care for CFTR
variant-specific therapy for people with CF, from the European Cystic Fibrosis
Society (2023).4 However, the Standards do not reflect the currently approved age
indications for Kalydeco® (ivacaftor tablets and oral granules) [≥ 1 months of age],
Orkambi (≥ 1 year of age), or Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor; ivacaftor
co-packaged tablets and granules) [≥ 2 years of age]. In general, Trikafta is
recommended over other agents where indications overlap. The Standards
recommend Trikafta in patients ≥ 6 years of age with CF who are homozygous or
heterozygous for F508del. In patients with one or more responsive non-F508del
variant, Kalydeco, Symdeko® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets; ivacaftor tablets), or
Trikafta are recommended. Kalydeco is recommended in patients ≥ 4 months of
age with eligible CFTR gene variants. Orkambi is recommended for patients 2 to 5
years of age who are homozygous for F508del. Of note, the Standards state that
after diagnosis, repeat sweat testing provides evidence of treatment effect on CFTR
activity, but does not predict clinical response. The European Cystic Fibrosis Society
Standards for establishing and maintaining health (2024) note that people with CF
with eligible CFTR gene variants should be offered CFTR modulator therapy.4
According to the CF Foundation (2017), CF is diagnosed when an individual has
both a clinical presentation of CF and evidence of CFTR dysfunction.2,3 Clinical
presentation of CF includes a positive newborn screening, signs and/or symptoms
of CF, and/or family history of CF. To establish a diagnosis of CF, sweat chloride
tests should be considered first, then CFTR genetic analysis (CFTR genotype), and
then CFTR physiologic tests (nasal potential difference [NPD] or intestinal current
measurement [ICM]). However, tests of CFTR function are not always done in this
order. All individuals diagnosed with CF should have a sweat chloride test and CFTR
genetic analysis performed.
In a patient with a sweat chloride test ≥ 60 mmol/L, CF diagnosis is established and
in patients with a sweat chloride test < 30 mmol/L, a diagnosis of CF is unlikely.2,3
Rarely, patients with a sweat chloride < 30 mmol/L may be considered to have CF if
alternatives are excluded and other confirmatory tests (genetic and physiologic
testing) support CF. In patients with a sweat chloride test of ≥ 30 to < 60 mmol/L,
CFTR genetic analysis is undertaken. If the genetic analysis identifies two CF-
causing CFTR mutations, CF is diagnosed, if no CFTR mutations are identified, a
diagnosis of CF is unlikely. In patients with a CFTR genotype that is undefined or of
varying clinical consequence, full gene CFTR sequencing (if not already performed)
or CFTR physiologic testing is performed (NPD or ICM). If only one CFTR variant is
identified on limited analysis, full gene CFTR sequencing should be performed. CF is
possible if both alleles possess CF-causing, undefined, or mutation of varying
clinical consequence mutations; CF is unlikely if only no CF-causing mutations are
found. If results of the NPD or ICM show CFTR dysfunction, CF is diagnosed; when
testing is unavailable or equivocal, the diagnosis of CF is not resolved, and when
results of the physiologic testing show CFTR function is preserved, a diagnosis of CF

– Orkambi Prior Authorization Policy
is considered unlikely. It is recommended that patients with challenging diagnoses
be evaluated at an accredited CF Foundation Care Center.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Orkambi. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Orkambi as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Orkambi to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor tablets and oral granules – Vertex)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Cystic Fibrosis, Homozygous for the F508del Mutation in the Cystic
Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Gene. Approve for 1 year
if the patient meets ALL of the following (A, B, C, D, and E):
A) Patient is ≥ 1 year of age; AND
B) Patient has TWO copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator gene; AND
C) Patient meets at least ONE of the following (i, ii, or iii):
i. Positive cystic fibrosis newborn screening test; OR
ii. Family history of cystic fibrosis; OR
iii. Clinical presentation consistent with signs and symptoms of cystic
fibrosis; AND
Note: Examples of clinical presentation of cystic fibrosis include but are
not limited to meconium ileus, sino-pulmonary symptoms (e.g., persistent
cough, wheezing, pulmonary function tests consistent with obstructive
airway disease, excess sputum production), bronchiectasis, sinusitis,
failure to thrive, pancreatic insufficiency.
D) Patient has evidence of abnormal cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator function as demonstrated by at least ONE of the following (i, ii, or
iii):
i. Elevated sweat chloride test; OR

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
Page 3 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator
– Orkambi Prior Authorization Policy
• Orkambi® (lumacaftor/ivacaftor tablets and oral granules – Vertex)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Cystic Fibrosis, Heterozygous for the F508del Mutation in the Cystic
Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Gene. Orkambi is not
indicated for a patient with only one copy of the F508del mutation in the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene.1
2. Combination Therapy with Other Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane
Conductance Regulator Modulator(s). Orkambi contains ivacaftor, the active
agent in Kalydeco® (tablets and oral granules) and therefore is not indicated in
combination with Kalydeco. Symdeko® (tezacaftor/ivacaftor tablets; ivacaftor
tablets) and Trikafta® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor; ivacaftor co-packaged
tablets and granules) contain ivacaftor and are therefore not indicated in
combination with Orkambi.
Note: Examples of other cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
modulators are: Alyftrek™ (vanzacaftor/tezacaftor/deutivacaftor tablets),
Kalydeco (ivacaftor tablets and oral granules), Symdeko (tezacaftor/ivacaftor;
ivacaftor tablets), Trikafta (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor; ivacaftor co-
packaged tablets and granules).
3. Infertility. Orkambi is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis in a patient
≥ 1 year of age who is homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic
fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene.1
Note: A patient with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis should be reviewed using
criteria for the FDA-approved indication, above.
