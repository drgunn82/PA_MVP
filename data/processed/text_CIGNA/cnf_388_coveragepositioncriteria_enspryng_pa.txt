INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Enspryng, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in adults who are anti-
aquaporin-4 antibody positive.1
Disease Overview
NMOSD is a rare, relapsing, autoimmune disorder of the brain and spinal cord with
optic neuritis and/or myelitis as predominant characteristic symptoms.2 NMOSD
often causes significant, permanent damage to vision and/or spinal cord function
resulting in blindness or impaired mobility.3 Patients may experience pain, paralysis,
loss of bowel and bladder control, loss of visual acuity, and uncontrolled motor
functions. Complications can lead to death.
Recommendations
The Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS) published revised recommendations
for the treatment of NMOSD in 2024.4 The standard of care for the treatment of
NMOSD attacks (for both AQP4-IgG-positive and double-negative cases) are high-
dose glucocorticoids and/or apheresis therapy. Long-term immunotherapy is
recommended for patients with AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD. NEMOS notes the first-
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Enspryng Prior Authorization Policy
choice therapies for the treatment of AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD are Enspryng,
eculizumab intravenous infusion (Soliris®, biosimilars), Ultomiris® (ravulizumab-cwyz
intravenous infusion), Uplizna® (inebilizumab-cdon intravenous infusion), and
rituximab. The order of preference for these therapies is unclear and further
comparative trials and real-world data are needed. The choice of treatment is
dependent on several factors, including disease activity and severity, mode and onset
of action, possibility to combine it with immunosuppressive drugs, effect on
autoimmune and other comorbidities, gender (family planning issues), frequency and
route of administration, side effect profile as well as patient and physician preference.
In general, if a patient fails a first-choice treatment, another first-choice treatment
should be tried; other options include use of a second-choice treatment (azathioprine,
mycophenolate mofetil, low-dose oral glucocorticoids) or the addition of a second-
choice treatment to the regimen.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Enspryng.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Enspryng as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Enspryng to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
