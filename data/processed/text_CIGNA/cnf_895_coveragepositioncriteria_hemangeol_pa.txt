INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Hemangeol, a beta-adrenergic blocker, is indicated for the treatment of proliferating
infantile hemangioma requiring systemic therapy.1 Initiate treatment at ages 5 weeks to 5
months.
Disease Overview
Infantile hemangiomas are common pediatric vascular tumors;2,3 they may occur in up to
5% of infants.4 The pathogenesis is not clearly known but may be due to the proliferation of
endothelial cells present in the chorionic villi of the placenta.3 Onset may occur as early as a
few weeks after birth. The most significant growth occurs between 1 month to 3 months of
age.4 Although hemangiomas may occur anywhere on the body, most occur on the head
and neck. Some are small and resolve on their own without treatment.2-4 Others, due to
their size the location, are disfiguring (e.g., those present in the facial region), cause
functional impairment (e.g., periorbital infantile hemangiomas), or lead to permanent skin
changes (scarring).2-4 Early active interventions should be sought for infantile
hemangiomas that are problematic (ideally by before 5 weeks of age).3
Guidelines
The American Academy of Pediatrics published clinical practice guidelines for the
management of infantile hemangiomas in 2019.4 Regarding pharmacological therapy, oral
propranolol is the treatment of choice for problematic infantile hemangiomas that require
Page 1 of 3 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hemangeol Prior Authorization with Step Therapy Policy
systemic treatment. Oral prednisolone or prednisone may be used for infantile
hemangiomas if there are contraindications or if patients have experienced an inadequate
response to propranolol. Intralesional injection of triamcinolone and/or betamethasone may
be used to treat focal, bulky infantile hemangiomas during proliferation or in selected critical
anatomic locations (e.g., the lip). Topical timolol may be utilized to treat some thin and/or
superficial infantile hemangiomas. Surgery and/or laser treatment may be used for selected
patients. Early intervention (ideally by 1 month of age) is recommended for infants who
may have problematic infantile hemangiomas. It is notable that infantile hemangiomas have
a maximum growth potential between 1 and 3 months of age; the majority of growth is
complete by 5 months of age. However, deeper infantile hemangiomas may have a slightly
later onset and more prolonged duration of growth. By 5 to 12 months of age, most infantile
hemangiomas have stopped growing and are beginning to involute. Changes in color of the
infantile hemangiomas may change from red to milky-white or gray. Lesions gradually
flatten and shrink. In general, infantile hemangioma involution is complete by 4 years of
age in 90% of patients. Extended therapy may need to account for the remainder of the
infantile hemangiomas.
Safety
Hemangeol is contraindicated in the following conditions: premature infants with corrected
age < 5 weeks; infants weighing less than 2 kg; asthma or history of bronchospasm; heart
rate < 80 beats per minute, greater than first degree heart block, or decompensated heart
failure; blood pressure < 50/30 mmHg; and pheochromocytoma.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Hemangeol. There
is also a Step Therapy component which applies only to a patient ≥ 6 months of age. When
Step Therapy applies, a trial of generic propranolol is required prior to Hemangeol.
