CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Rukobia is a human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) gp120-directed attachment
inhibitor.1 It is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral(s) [ARVs] for the
treatment of HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults with
multidrug-resistant HIV-1 infection failing their current ARV regimen due to
resistance, intolerance, or safety considerations.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Rukobia was established in one ongoing, Phase III, multicenter, 96-
week pivotal study in heavily treatment-experienced adults with HIV-1 infection
failing their current ARV regimen (BRIGHTE; n = 371).2,5 Eligible patients were ≥ 18
years of age and had failure of their current ARV regimen (baseline HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400
copies/mL), with no viable ARV combination therapy due to exhaustion of a least four
Page 1 of 6: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Human Immunodeficiency Virus -
Rukobia Prior Authorization Policy
of six ARV classes (i.e., nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, CCR5
antagonists, and entry inhibitors). Exhaustion was defined as the elimination of all
ARVs within a given class as a fully active option to pair with Rukobia because of
resistance, previous adverse events, or unwillingness to use Fuzeon® (enfuvirtide
subcutaneous injection). Patients were assigned to one of two cohorts, “randomized”
or “non-randomized”, based on the number of fully active available ARVs with which
to construct an optimized background regimen. Patients in the randomized cohort
had one or two available fully active ARVs while those in the non-randomized cohort
had no available fully active ARVs. There were 15 patients who received Trogarzo®
(ibalizumab-uiyk intravenous injection) in combination with Rukobia in the original
study (after approval of Rukobia, in 2018, 6 patients in the randomized cohort added
Trogarzo to their optimized background therapy). At Week 48 (all patients on
Rukobia + optimized background therapy), 54% of patients achieved viral
suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 40 copies/mL) and CD4 T-cell count increased to a mean
of 139 cells/mm3 (median baseline 99 cells/mm3). At Week 96, viral suppression was
maintained or improved (60% of patients in the randomized cohort and 37% of
patients in the non-randomized cohort).5 Virologic response rates (in the intent-to-
treat population) at Week 240 decreased to 45% in the randomized cohort and to
22% in the non-randomized cohort; however, this included 24 patients (n = 19 in
the randomized cohort and n = 5 in the non-randomized cohort) who did not have
virologic data due to Coronaviris-19-related disruptions to care. At Week 240, in the
observed analysis, HIV-1 RNA was < 40 copies/mL in 82% of patients in the
randomized cohort and in 66% of patients in the non-randomized cohort and was <
400 copies/mL in 95% and 80% of patients in the randomized and non-randomized
cohorts, respectively. Mean CD4 T-cell count increased through Week 192 in the
randomized cohort and remained similar at Week 240; in the non-randomized cohort,
CD4 T-cell count increased through Week 240. A safety analysis reported additional
findings.7 At Week 102, 58% of patients with CD4 T-cell count < 200 cells/mm3 at
baseline had on-treatment CD4 T-cell count reported at Week 192, and 75% of these
patients had a CD4 T-cell count ≥ 200 cells/mm2. In addition, acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome-defining events were lower among patients with CD4 T-
cell count ≥ 200 cells/mm3 vs. < 200 cells/mm3.

Guidelines
According to the Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines (September
12, 2024) for the use of Antiviral Agents in Adults and Adolescents with HIV Infection,
treatment-experienced patients with ongoing detectable viremia who lack sufficient
treatment options to construct a fully suppressive regimen may be candidates for
Trogarzo, Rukobia, and/or Sunlenca® (lenacapavir tablets/subcutaneous injection).3
Patients who continue to have detectable viremia and who lack sufficient treatment
options to construct a fully suppressive regimen may also be candidates for research
studies or expanded access programs, or they may qualify for single-patient access
to an investigational new drug as specified in FDA regulations. The goal of therapy
is maximal virologic suppression; however, if it cannot be achieved, the goals of
therapy are to preserve immunologic function (e.g., CD4 T-cell count), prevent
clinical progression, and minimize the development of further resistance that may
compromise future regimens. CD4 T-cell count is recommended to be monitored at
entry into care, when switching or modifying ARVs, and then every 3, 6, or 12 months
depending on CD4 T-cell count and the duration of viral suppression. The CD4 count
response to ARV therapy varies widely, but a poor CD4 response in a patient with
viral suppression is rarely an indication for modifying a treatment regimen.
The International Antiviral Society-USA Recommendations (2024) for the Treatment
and Prevention of HIV in Adults recommend agents with novel mechanisms of action
(e.g., Trogarzo, Rukobia, or Sunlenca), ideally in combination with two fully active
ARVs in individuals with virologic failure with extensive multiclass resistance.4 In the
setting of integrase strand-transfer inhibitor resistance, Trogarzo, Rukobia, or
Sunlenca are similarly recommended in combination with two fully active ARVs.
Consensus recommendations for the use of novel ARVs in individuals with HIV who
are heavily treatment-experienced and/or have multidrug-resistant HIV-1 endorsed
by the American Academy of HIV Medicine and the American College of Clinical
Pharmacology (2024) recommend adding Rukobia to an optimized background
regimen that includes at least one other active drug in patients with multidrug
resistant HIV-1 who are heavily treatment-experienced and are unable to achieve or
maintain viral suppression on their current ARV regimen.8 If an active drug cannot
be included in the optimized background regimen, then the regimen should include
partially active agents (preferably several). Prior treatment with Trogarzo should not
impact candidacy for Rukobia.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Rukobia. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Rukobia as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Rukobia to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
