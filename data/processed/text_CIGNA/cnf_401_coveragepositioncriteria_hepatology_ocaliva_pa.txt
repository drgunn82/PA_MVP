INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ocaliva, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, is indicated for the treatment of primary
biliary cholangitis in adults without cirrhosis, or with compensated cirrhosis who
do not have evidence of portal hypertension.1 It is specifically indicated to be given
either in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an
inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.
Guidelines
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines for
primary biliary cholangitis (2018) state that the diagnosis can be confirmed when
patients meet two of the following criteria: 1) there is cholestasis as evidenced by
alkaline phosphatase elevation; 2) anti-mitochondrial antibodies are present, or if
negative for anti-mitochondrial antibodies, other primary biliary cholangitis-specific
autoantibodies, including sp100 or gp210, are present; 3) there is histologic
evidence of nonsuppurative destructive cholangitis and destruction of interlobular
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hepatology – Ocaliva Prior Authorization Policy
bile ducts. It is specifically noted that diagnosis in a patient who is negative for
anti-mitochondrial antibodies does not require a liver biopsy if other diagnostic
criteria are met.4 Treatment with UDCA (available in the US as ursodiol) is the
recommended treatment for patients with primary biliary cholangitis who have
abnormal liver enzyme values regardless of histologic stage.3 Following 12 months
of UDCA therapy, the patient should be evaluated to determine if second-line
therapy is appropriate. It is estimated that up to 40% of patients have an
inadequate response to UDCA; Ocaliva should be considered for these patients. An
update to the 2018 AASLD guidelines for primary biliary cholangitis (2021) provide
two updated recommendations:9 1) Fibrates can be considered as off-label
alternatives for patients with primary biliary cholangitis and inadequate response
to UDCA. However, fibrates are discouraged in patients with decompensated liver
disease; and 2) Ocaliva is contraindicated in patients with advanced cirrhosis,
defined as cirrhosis with current or prior evidence of liver decompensation (e.g.,
encephalopathy, coagulopathy) or portal hypertension (e.g., ascites,
gastroesophageal varices, or persistent thrombocytopenia). In addition, the AASLD
recommends careful monitoring of any patient with cirrhosis, even if not advanced,
receiving Ocaliva.
The European Association for the Study of the Liver guidelines for diagnosis and
management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (2017) make similar
recommendations.7
Safety
Ocaliva has a Boxed warning regarding hepatic decompensation and failure in
patients with primary biliary cholangitis and cirrhosis.1 Ocaliva is contraindicated in
patients with primary biliary cholangitis with decompensated cirrhosis and patients
with a prior decompensation event. It is also contraindicated in patients with
compensated cirrhosis with evidence of portal hypertension (e.g., ascites,
gastroesophageal varices, and persistent thrombocytopenia) as well as those with
complete biliary obstruction.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Ocaliva. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Ocaliva as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Ocaliva to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
• Ocaliva® (obeticholic acid tablets – Intercept Pharmaceuticals)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):

FDA-Approved Indication
1. Primary Biliary Cholangitis. Approve Ocaliva for the duration noted if the

cholangitis as defined by TWO of the following (TWO of a, b, or c):
a) Alkaline phosphatase is elevated above the upper limit of normal as
defined by normal laboratory reference values; OR
b) Positive anti-mitochondrial antibodies or other primary biliary
cholangitis-specific auto-antibodies, including sp100 or gp210, if anti-
mitochondrial antibodies are negative; OR
c) Histologic evidence of primary biliary cholangitis from a liver biopsy;
AND
iii. Patient meets ONE of the following (a or b):

ii. Patient has responded to Ocaliva as determined by the prescriber.
Note: Examples of a response to Ocaliva therapy are improved
biochemical markers of primary biliary cholangitis (e.g., alkaline
phosphatase [ALP], bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT],
aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT]).

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Ocaliva® (obeticholic acid tablets – Intercept Pharmaceuticals)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Alcoholic Liver Disease. There are no data available to support the use of
Ocaliva in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Ocaliva is not FDA-approved for this
indication and current alcoholic liver disease guidelines from AASLD (2019) do
not make recommendations regarding therapy with Ocaliva.1,8 Additional well-
controlled studies are needed.
2. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), including Nonalcoholic Fatty
Liver (NAFL) or Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). Ocaliva is not FDA-
approved for this indication and current NAFLD guidelines from AASLD (2023) do
not recommend the off-label use of obeticholic acid to treat NASH until additional
safety and efficacy data become available.1,8
