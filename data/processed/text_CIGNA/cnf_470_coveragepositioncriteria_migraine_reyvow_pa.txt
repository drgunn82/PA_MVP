SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Reyvow, a serotonin subtype 1F receptor agonist, is indicated for the acute treatment of
migraine with or without aura in adults.1 Limitations of Use: Reyvow is not indicated for
the preventive treatment of migraine.
Disease Overview
Migraine is a common, ongoing condition marked by paroxysmal, unilateral attacks of
moderate to severe throbbing headache which are aggravated by routine physical activity
(e.g., walking or climbing stairs) and associated with nausea, vomiting, and/or photophobia
and phonophobia.2 Migraines have been defined as chronic or episodic. Chronic migraine is
described by the International Headache Society as headache occurring on ≥ 15
days/month for more than 3 months, which has the features of migraine headache on ≥ 8
days/month. Episodic migraine is characterized by headaches that occur < 15 days/month.3
Guidelines
Triptans (e.g., almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan,
and zolmitriptan) are considered the gold standard for acute treatment of moderate to
severe migraine headaches or mild to moderate migraine headaches that respond poorly to
over-the-counter analgesics. An assessment of the preventive and acute treatment of
migraine by the American Headache Society (2018; updated 2021) reaffirms previous
migraine guidelines.4,5 The update lists the triptans, dihydroergotamine, the oral gepants
(Nurtec® ODT [rimegepant orally disintegrating tablets,] and Ubrelvy® [ubrogepant
tablets]), and Reyvow as effective treatments for moderate or severe acute migraine

attacks and mild to moderate attacks that respond poorly to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, non-opioid analgesics, acetaminophen, or caffeinated combinations (e.g., aspirin +
acetaminophen + caffeine). The recommendation remains that clinicians must consider
medication efficacy and potential medication-related adverse events when prescribing acute
medications for migraine.
