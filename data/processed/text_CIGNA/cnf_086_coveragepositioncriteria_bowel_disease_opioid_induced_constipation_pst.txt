INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Movantik, Relistor (tablets and injection), and Symproic are indicated for the
treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adults with chronic non-cancer
pain, including patients with chronic pain related to prior cancer or its treatment
who do not require frequent (e.g., weekly) opioid dosage escalation.1-3
Additionally, Relistor injection (not tablets) is indicated for the treatment of OIC in
adults with advanced illness or pain caused by active cancer who require
opioid dosage escalation for palliative care.2 Movantik, Relistor, and Symproic
are mu-opioid receptor antagonists that act peripherally in tissues such as the
gastrointestinal tract, thereby decreasing the constipating effects of opioids.
Guidelines
The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) published a guideline and
technical review on opioid-induced constipation in 2019.4,5 In patients with
laxative-refractory OIC, the AGA recommends Symproic or Movantik and suggests
Relistor (tablets or injection).4 The technical review notes that the quality of

Step Therapy Policy
evidence was rated down for Relistor due in part to the short duration of the trials
(4 weeks, followed by as-needed dosing for 8 weeks).5
An additional guideline from the American Academy of Pain Medicine (AAPM) [2017]
notes that peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists, including Movantik
and Relistor, have demonstrated efficacy in reducing OIC.6 The AAPM guideline was
written prior to the approval of Symproic.
POLICY STATEMENT
This program has been developed to encourage the use of two Step 1 Products
prior to the use of a Step 2 Product. If the Preferred Step Therapy rule is not met
for a Step 2 Product at the point of service, coverage will be determined by the
Preferred Step Therapy criteria below. All approvals are provided for 1 year in
duration.
Note: Amitiza® (lubiprostone capsules) is not targeted in this Policy.
Step 1: Movantik, Symproic
Step 2: Relistor tablets, Relistor injection
Bowel Agents – Opioid-Induced Constipation Preferred Step Therapy Policy
product(s) is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following
preferred step therapy criteria is(are) met. Any other exception is
considered not medically necessary.
CRITERIA

care, approve.
