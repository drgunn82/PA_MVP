CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Kineret, an interleukin-1 (IL-1) blocker, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), for treatment of
neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID).
• Deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA) treatment.
• Rheumatoid arthritis, to reduce the signs and symptoms and slow the
progression of structural damage with moderately to severely active disease
in adults who have failed one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
(DMARDs); Kineret can be used ± DMARDs, other than tumor necrosis factor
inhibitors (TNFis).
Guidelines
Page 1 of 13 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Kineret Prior Authorization
Kineret is used for treatment of a variety of periodic fever syndromes and
inflammatory conditions.
CAPS and DIRA
The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and American
College of Rheumatology (ACR) [2021] provide treatment guidelines for IL-1
mediated autoinflammatory diseases: CAPS, tumor necrosis factor receptor-
associated periodic syndrome, mevalonate kinase deficiency, and deficiency of the
IL-1 receptor antagonist.2 Guidelines indicate IL-blocking therapy has become the
preferred treatment and a therapeutic trial with IL-1 blocking agents may be started
when strong clinical suspicious of a diagnosis of CAPS, TRAPS, MKD, or DIRA is
suspected. The guidelines also provide additional diagnosis-specific treatment
recommendations:
• CAPS: CAPS encompasses three rare genetic syndromes (familial cold
autoinflammatory syndrome, Muckle-Wells syndrome, and neonatal onset
multisystem inflammatory disease formerly known as chronic infantile
neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome) that are thought to be one
condition along a spectrum of disease severity. IL-1 blockers are
recommended as standard of care across the spectrum of disease for
improved symptom control and reduced systemic and tissue/organ
inflammation. The dose and/or frequency of administration should be
adjusted to control disease activity, normalize markers of systemic
inflammation, and for appropriate weight gain and development in the
growing patient. In many cases, patients with CAPS reported an immediate
clinical response to Kineret with rash, fever, and arthritis disappearing within
a few days and not recurring during follow-up.3 Dramatic and persistent
normalization of inflammatory markers and hematologic tests have also been
achieved.
• DIRA: DIRA is caused by recessive loss-of-function pathogenic variants in
the IL1RN gene.2 Treatment with agents that block both IL-α and IL-β is
recommended and includes Kineret and Arcalyst (rilonacept subcutaneous
injection). Kineret approval for the treatment of DIRA was based on a
natural-history study in nine patients (aged 1 month to 9 years at baseline)
with genetically confirmed DIRA.1 Patients were treated with Kineret for up
to 10 years. All nine patients achieved remission while on Kineret for DIRA.
In some patients, skin and bone manifestations resolved within days and
weeks, respectively.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Current recommendations for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis from the
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [2021] do not make a recommendation
for the use of Kineret.4 The recommendations also note that Kineret is used
infrequently for rheumatoid arthritis and that TNFis and other non-TNFi biologics
(i.e., rituximab, Actemra® [tocilizumab intravenous infusion, tocilizumab
subcutaneous injection], and Orencia® [abatacept intravenous infusion, abatacept
subcutaneous injection]) are appropriate initial biologic therapy for most patients
with rheumatoid arthritis.
Page 2 of 13 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Kineret Prior Authorization
Still’s disease [including Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (SJIA) and
Still’s Disease, Adult Onset (AOSD)]
The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) and Pediatric
Rheumatology European Society (PReS) joint clinical guidelines for management of
Still’s disease (2024) indicate SJIA and AOSD are the same disease, differing in age
of onset, and can be referred to collectively as Still’s disease.5 Guidelines
recommend an IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitor be initiated as early as possible after diagnosis.
No preferred agent is provided. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), which is a
life-threatening complication of Still’s disease, should be treated with high dose
steroids and if needed, other treatments which includes Kineret.
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends Kineret for
treatment or supportive care for the following uses:
• Castleman Disease: NCCN guidelines (version 2.2025 – January 28, 2025)
list Kineret as an alternative regimen for subsequent therapy as a single
agent for multicentric Castleman disease that is relapsed or refractory
disease.13
• Histiocytic Neoplasms: NCCN guidelines (version 1.2025 – June 20, 2025)
provide recommendations for Kineret as first-line or subsequent treatment
for Erdheim-Chester disease regardless of mutation.14
• Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities: NCCN guidelines (version 1.2025 –
December 20, 2024) provide recommendations for use of Kineret as a
treatment option in the management of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH-like syndrome), chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) T-cell-related toxicities, including prophylaxis of immune
effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), and for the
management of cytokine release syndrome.15
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Kineret. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Kineret as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Kineret to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Kineret® (anakinra subcutaneous injection – Swedish Orphan
Biovitrim)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Ankylosing Spondylitis. Kineret has been beneficial in a few patients with
ankylosing spondylitis, but results are not consistent.6,7 In a small open-label
study, patients with active ankylosing spondylitis who were refractory to NSAIDs
(n = 20) received Kineret 100 mg daily.15 The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis
Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) score decreased over a 6-month period but was
not significant (5.8 at baseline vs. 5.0 at Week 12, and 4.8 at Week 24). No
significant change was found in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index
(BASFI) and patients’ and physicians’ global assessment of general pain during
the study. After 12 weeks, both the assessment in ankylosing spondylitis (ASAS)
20 and 40 responses improved in 10.5% of patients (intention-to-treat
analysis). After 24 weeks, ASAS 20 was attained in 26% of patients, ASAS 40 in
21% of patients, and ASAS 70 in 10.5% of patients. Guidelines for axial
spondyloarthritis from the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society
(ASAS)/European Union Against Rheumatism (EULAR) [2016] do not mention
Kineret as a treatment option.8
2. Concurrent Use with a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination
Page 8 of 13 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Kineret Prior Authorization
with another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used
for an inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination
therapy is generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of
adverse events and lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.9
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of conventional synthetic disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs (e.g., methotrexate, leflunomide,
hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine) in combination with this medication.
3. Lupus Arthritis. The effectiveness and safety of Kineret were evaluated in an
open 3-month pilot trial in patients (n = 4) with systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE) and severe, therapy-refractory non-erosive polyarthritis (three patients
had deforming Jaccoud’s arthropathy) and no other uncontrolled major organ
involvement.10 Patients were refractory to NSAIDs, antimalarials,
corticosteroids, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine. SLE was
controlled with stable doses of corticosteroids and/or antirheumatic or
immunosuppressive agents; pain was managed with NSAIDs and/or other
medications. Patients had improved clinically after 4 weeks on Kineret, but after
12 weeks, the clinical activity parameters tended to increase again. The results
from this study are preliminary and a larger controlled study is needed.
4. Osteoarthritis. In a Phase II study in patients with painful osteoarthritis of the
knee, Kineret 150 mg administered by intraarticular injection was well
tolerated.11 The study was not designed to assess the analgesic efficacy of
Kineret. Patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were enrolled in a multicenter,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study and randomized to Kineret 50 mg,
Kineret 150 mg, or placebo for intraarticular injection.12 Although the injections
were well tolerated, there were no significant differences in improvement in
knee pain, stiffness, function or cartilage turnover between Kineret doses and
placebo. Similar to other studies in this population, there was a significant
placebo effect noted.
