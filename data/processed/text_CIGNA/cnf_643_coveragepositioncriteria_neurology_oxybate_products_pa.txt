CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Lumryz, sodium oxybate oral solution, and Xywav, central nervous system (CNS)
depressants, are indicated for the following uses:1-3
• Cataplexy treatment in patients with narcolepsy. Lumryz, Sodium
oxybate oral solution and Xywav are indicated in patients ≥ 7 years of age.
• Excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. Lumryz, Sodium oxybate oral
solution and Xywav are indicated in patients ≥ 7 years of age.
Additionally, Xywav is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in
adults.2
Two specialized tests, which can be performed in a sleep disorders clinic, are required
to establish a diagnosis of narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia.4 Polysomnography
is an overnight recording of brain and muscle activity, breathing, and eye
movements. The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) assesses daytime sleepiness by
measuring how quickly a person falls asleep and whether they enter rapid eye

Policy
movement (REM) sleep. Polysomnography is routinely indicated for the diagnosis of
sleep-related breathing disorders; for continuous positive airway pressure titration in
patients with sleep-related breathing disorders; with an MSLT in the evaluation of
suspected narcolepsy; and in certain atypical or unusual parasomnias.5 The MSLT is
indicated as part of the evaluation of patients with suspected narcolepsy to confirm
the diagnosis or patients who are thought to have idiopathic hypersomnia to exclude
other causes of hypersomnia. Most patients with narcolepsy have objective evidence
of hypersomnia as determined by a mean sleep latency < 5 minutes. In studies, the
presence of two or more sleep-onset REM episodes (SOREMPs) was associated with
a sensitivity of 0.78 and a specificity of 0.93 for the diagnosis of narcolepsy. SOREMPs
do not occur exclusively in patients with narcolepsy; thus, it is important to rule out
or treat other sleep disorders before evaluating SOREMPs in the diagnosis of
narcolepsy. Diagnostic criteria for patients with idiopathic hypersomnia include a
mean sleep latency ≤ 8 minutes and MSLT results showing < 2 SOREMPs or no
SOREMPs if the REM sleep latency preceding polysomnogram is ≤ 15 minutes; also,
these patients do not have cataplexy. For these reasons, polysomnography and an
MSLT performed on the day after the polysomnographic evaluation are routinely
indicated in the evaluation of suspected narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia.
Guidelines
Pertinent medical guidelines related to oxybate products are summarized below; of
note, Lumryz and Xywav are not addressed in any of the guidelines.
Narcolepsy and Cataplexy
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) practice parameters for the
treatment of central disorders of hypersomnolence were updated in 2021.6,7
• Modafinil, Wakix® (pitolisant tablets), sodium oxybate, and Sunosi® (solriamfetol
tablets) are recommended as effective treatments for daytime sleepiness due to
narcolepsy and reducing disease severity in adults (Strong Recommendation for
each).
• Wakix and sodium oxybate have also demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of
cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy (Strong Recommendation for each).
• Sodium oxybate and armodafinil have Conditional Recommendations for the
treatment of narcolepsy, showing efficacy for daytime sleepiness due to
narcolepsy and reducing disease severity.
• Dextroamphetamine has a Conditional Recommendation for the treatment of
narcolepsy, showing efficacy for excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy.
• Methylphenidate has a Conditional Recommendation for the treatment of
narcolepsy, showing efficacy in reducing disease severity.
• There was insufficient and inconclusive evidence to make recommendations for l-
carnitine, scheduled naps, selegiline, triazolam, selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
• Modafinil and sodium oxybate have Conditional Recommendations for the
treatment of narcolepsy in pediatric patients.
Note: A Strong Recommendation should be followed by clinicians under most
circumstances. A Conditional Recommendation requires that the clinician use clinical
knowledge and experience and strongly consider the individual patient’s values and
preferences to determine the best course of action.
6 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Neurology – Oxybate Products Prior Authorization Policy
Idiopathic Hypersomnia
The AASM guideline includes recommendations for the treatment of idiopathic
hypersomnia.6,7
• Only modafinil has a Strong recommendation for use.
• Clarithromycin, methylphenidate, Wakix, and sodium oxybate have Conditional
recommendations for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia in adults.
Safety
Sodium oxybate is the sodium salt of gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and Xywav is
a mixed salt formulation of GHB.1-3 They are both Schedule III controlled substances.
Abuse of GHB (a Schedule I controlled substance), either alone or in combination
with other CNS depressants, is associated with CNS adverse reactions, including
seizure, respiratory depression, decreases in the level of consciousness, coma, and
death. Because of the risks of CNS depression, abuse, and misuse, sodium oxybate
oral solution and Xywav are available only through a restricted distribution program
under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Xyrem/Xywav
Success Program, using a centralized pharmacy. Healthcare professionals who
prescribe sodium oxybate oral solution or Xywav and patients must enroll in the
Xyrem/Xywav Success Program and must comply with the requirements to ensure
the drug’s safe use. Similarly, Lumryz is only available through a restricted
distribution program under a REMS called the Lumryz REMS. Healthcare providers
who prescribe Lumryz must be specially certified; Lumryz will be dispensed only by
pharmacies that are specially certified; and Lumryz will be dispensed and shipped
only to patients who are enrolled in the Lumryz REMS with documentation of safe use
conditions.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Lumryz,
sodium oxybate oral solution, and Xywav. All approvals are provided for the duration
noted below. Because of the specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis
of patients treated with Lumryz, sodium oxybate oral solution, and Xywav as well as
the monitoring required for adverse event and long-term efficacy, approval requires
these products to be prescribed by a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
• Lumryz™ (sodium oxybate extended-release oral suspension –
Avadel)
• Xyrem® (sodium oxybate oral solution - Jazz, generic)
• Xywav® (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates oral

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Lumryz™ (sodium oxybate extended-release oral suspension –
Avadel)
• Xyrem® (sodium oxybate oral solution - Jazz, generic)
• Xywav® (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybates oral
solution – Jazz)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Fibromyalgia. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) issued
evidence-based recommendations for the management of fibromyalgia (2016)
stating that initial management should involve patient education and focus on
non-pharmacological therapies.8 EULAR’s position on sodium oxybate for
fibromyalgia is strongly against with 94% agreement. Duloxetine, pregabalin
capsules and oral solution, and Savella® (milnacipran tablets) are indicated for
the treatment of fibromyalgia.9-11 Other recommended treatments include
tricyclic antidepressants (i.e., amitriptyline), cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, and
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (i.e., fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine).12
2. Concomitant use of Lumryz, sodium oxybate oral solution, and/or Xywav
with each other or an oxybate product used in combination with Wakix
(pitolisant tablets) and/or Sunosi (solriamfetol tablets). Lumryz, sodium
oxybate oral solution. and Xywav have the same active ingredient (oxybate, a
CNS depressant) and have not been studied for use in combination or as
alternating treatments.1-3 Sunosi, a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor, is indicated to improve wakefulness in adults with excessive daytime
sleepiness due to narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea.13 Wakix, an
antagonist/inverse agonist of the histamine-3 receptor, is indicated for excessive
daytime sleepiness and cataplexy in adults with narcolepsy.14 Currently, there
are no published studies evaluating combination use of these medications.
