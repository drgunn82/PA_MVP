INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Deflazacort, a corticosteroid, is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular
Dystrophy (DMD) in patients ≥ 2 years of age.1 The efficacy and safety of deflazacort
have not been established in patients < 2 years of age. Jaythari is indicated for DMD in
patients ≥ 5 years of age.9 Due to PTC Therapeutics marketing exclusivity rights, Jaythari is
not approved in patients < 5 years of age.
Disease Overview
DMD is a rare, progressive X-linked disease resulting from mutation(s) of the DMD gene,
also known as the Dystrophin gene.2,3 Due to the mutation(s), the dystrophin protein,
which is key for maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cells, is not produced or very
minimally produced. Since this is an X-linked mutation, DMD almost exclusively impacts
young males. DMD is a progressive muscle-weakening disease that affects skeletal,
respiratory, and cardiac muscles. It is usually diagnosed in the second or third year of life.
Page 1 of 6 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Muscular Dystrophy – Deflazacort Prior Authorization
Policy
Due to progressive decline, most patients die of cardiac or respiratory complications in the
third or fourth decade of life. The incidence of DMD in the US is approximately 1 in 5,000
live male births.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy and safety of deflazacort were established in two pivotal trials in males with
DMD who were ≥ 5 years of age.7,8 In one study, treatment consisted of deflazacort 0.9
mg/kg/day, deflazacort 1.2 mg/kg/day, or prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day (n = 196).7 The
primary efficacy analysis, mean change from baseline to Week 12 in average muscle
strength (assessed by modified Medical Research Council [MRC]), demonstrated a
significant least squares (LS) mean difference in favor of active treatment vs. placebo:
deflazacort 0.9 mg/kg/day (0.25 vs. -0.1, P = 0.17), deflazacort 1.2 mg/kg/day (0.36 vs. -
0.1, P = 0.0003), and prednisone 0.75 mg/kg/day (0.37 vs. -0.1, P = 0.0002). Adverse
events (AEs) differed between prednisone and deflazacort treatment groups. Cushingoid
appearance (69.4%), erythema (41.8%), and hirsutism (39.3%) were observed in a
numerically greater proportion of patients in the prednisone group compared with either
dose of deflazacort. Central obesity was reported in a statistically significantly greater
proportion of patients treated with prednisone vs. deflazacort. Psychiatric AEs were
generally reported at a higher rate in the prednisone group compared with both deflazacort
groups.
Guidelines
Guidelines from the DMD Care Considerations Working Group (2018) state that
glucocorticoids and physical therapy are the mainstays of treatment for DMD.2-6 Both
therapies should be continued after the patient loses ambulation. Guidelines for the use of
corticosteroids in DMD are available from the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) [2016,
reaffirmed January 2022].4 The AAN notes that in patients with DMD, prednisone should be
used to improve strength and pulmonary function (moderate evidence). Emflaza™
(deflazacort tablets and oral suspension) and prednisone may be used to improve timed
motor function, reduce the need for scoliosis surgery, and delay the onset of
cardiomyopathy until the patient is 18 years of age (weak evidence). Emflaza may also be
used to improve pulmonary function and to delay the age at loss of ambulation by 1.4 to
2.5 years (weak evidence). There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the benefit of
prednisone on survival (insufficient evidence). Emflaza may be used to increase survival at
5 and 15 years of follow-up (weak evidence).
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of deflazacort. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with deflazacort as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires deflazacort
to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
Documentation: Documentation is required for use of deflazacort as noted in the criteria
as [documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not limited to, chart
notes, prescription claims records, prescription receipts, and/or other information. All
documentation must include patient-specific identifying information.
