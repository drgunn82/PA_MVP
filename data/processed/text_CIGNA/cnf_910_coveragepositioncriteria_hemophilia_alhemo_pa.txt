INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Alhemo, a tissue factor pathway inhibitor antagonist, is indicated for routine
prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in
adults and pediatric patients ≥ 12 years of age with 1) hemophilia A
(congenital Factor VIII deficiency) with or without Factor VIII inhibitors, or 2)
hemophilia B (congenital Factor IX deficiency) with or without Factor IX
inhibitors.1
Alhemo is recommended to be given as a 1 mg/kg loading dose on Day 1 as a
subcutaneous (SC) injection once daily (QD).1 On Day 2, the maintenance dose of
0.2 mg/kg SC QD is recommended with individualized doses based on Alhemo
concentrations obtained at 4 weeks following initiation of treatment. After proper
training, Alhemo may be self-administered.

Disease Overview
Hemophilia A and B are genetic bleeding disorders caused by a dysfunction or a
deficiency of coagulation Factor VIII and Factor IX, respectively.2-7 Because
hemophilia is an X-linked condition, males are primarily impacted. Patients who have
these types of hemophilias are not able to properly form clots in the blood and may
bleed for a longer time than normal following injury or surgery. Patients may also
experience spontaneous bleeding in muscles, joints, and organs. Bleeds may be life-
threatening. The main morbidity is hemophilic arthropathy, which limits mobility. It
is estimated that 33,000 males are living with hemophilia in the US; hemophilia A
accounts for around 80% of the cases (approximately 26,400 patients) and
hemophilia B comprises 20% of cases (around 6,600 patients). Hemophilias are often
classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on reduced Factor VIII or IX levels.
Approximately 50% and 30% of patients with hemophilia A and hemophilia B,
respectively, have severe disease. The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) to factor
products is a challenging complication as it causes Factor VIII and Factor IX therapies
to be ineffective, which increases bleeding frequency and severity. Inhibitors develop
in around 30% and 10% of patients with severe hemophilia A and hemophilia B,
respectively.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Alhemo. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Alhemo as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Alhemo to be prescribed by or in consultation with a hemophilia specialist.

New Policy -- 01/29/2025
7 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Hemophilia – Non-Factor Routine Prophylaxis Products –
Alhemo Prior Authorization Policy
Early Annual “Non-Factor Routine Prophylaxis Products” was added to the title of 06/11/2025
Revision the Policy. In addition, the following changes were made:
Hemophilia A with Factor VIII Inhibitors: In Initial Therapy and
for a Patient Currently Receiving Alhemo, a requirement was added
that according to the prescriber, prophylactic use of bypassing agents
will be discontinued (for Initial Therapy) or will not occur while
receiving Alhemo (for a Patient Currently Receiving Alhemo). A Note
was added that use of bypassing agents for the treatment of
breakthrough bleeding is permitted and examples of bypassing agents
were listed in a Note. Previously, use of bypassing agents for routine
prophylaxis was addressed in the Conditions Not Covered. Also, a
requirement was added that the patient is not undergoing immune
tolerance induction therapy. Previously, this was addressed in
Conditions Not Covered.
Hemophilia B with Factor IX Inhibitors: In Initial Therapy and for
a Patient Currently Receiving Alhemo, a requirement was added that
according to the prescriber, prophylactic use of bypassing agents will
be discontinued (for Initial Therapy) or will not occur while receiving
Alhemo (for a Patient Currently Receiving Alhemo). A Note was added
that use of bypassing agents for the treatment of breakthrough
bleeding is permitted and examples of bypassing agents were listed in
a Note. Previously, use of bypassing agents for routine prophylaxis
was addressed in the Conditions Not Covered. Also, a requirement was
added that the patient is not undergoing immune tolerance induction
therapy. Previously, this was addressed in Conditions Not Covered.
Conditions Not Covered: Regarding Concurrent Use of Non-Factor
Routine Prophylaxis Products, all agents are now listed together in one
criterion, which now includes Qfitlia. The condition of Concurrent Use
of Bypassing Agents for Routine Prophylaxis was removed as this is
now addressed in the approval criteria. The condition of Patient
Receiving Immune Tolerance Induction Therapy was removed as this
is now addressed in the approval criteria.
Selected Hemophilia A without Factor VIII Inhibitors: This condition and 08/13/2025
Revision criteria for approval were added to the policy.
Hemophilia B without Factor IX Inhibitors: This condition and
criteria for approval were added to the policy.
