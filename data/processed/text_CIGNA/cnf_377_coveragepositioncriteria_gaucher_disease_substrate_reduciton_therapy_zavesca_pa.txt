INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Miglustat capsules (Zavesca, generic), a glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, is
indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of mild to moderate Gaucher disease
type 1, in adults for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option
(e.g., due to allergy, hypersensitivity, or poor venous access).1
Disease Overview
Gaucher disease is caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme β-
glucocerebrosidase.2 This enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of
glucosylceramide into glucose and ceramide. In Gaucher disease, deficiency of the
enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase results in the accumulation of glucosylceramide
substrate in lysosomal compartment of macrophages, giving rise to foam cells or
“Gaucher cells.” Miglustat is a specific inhibitor of the enzyme glycosylceramide
synthase, which is responsible for producing the substrate glucosylceramide.1 By
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Gaucher Disease – Substrate Reduction Therapy –
Miglustat Prior Authorization Policy
functioning as a substrate reduction therapy, miglustat allows the residual activity of
the deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme to be more effective.
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
Although not FDA approved, miglustat has been used off-label for the treatment of
Niemann-Pick disease Type C (NPC). NPC is an autosomal recessive, slowly
progressive ultra-rare, lysosomal storage disorder.3 It is caused by variants in either
the NPC1 (90% to 95%) or NPC2 (5%) gene and yields deficient function of the
corresponding proteins that normally bind and transport cholesterol.4 Essentially,
NPC results from a combination of toxic lipid accumulation in the lysosomes and a
relative deficiency of necessary cholesterol in the rest of the cell. The lysosomal
dysfunction in NPC leads to an accumulation of lipids in the brain, liver, and spleen.
The clinical manifestations vary with age of onset and range from a neonatal rapidly
progressive fatal disorder to an adult-onset chronic neurodegenerative disease.5
Consensus clinical management guidelines for NPC have been developed by the
International Niemann-Pick Disease Registry (INPDR) project (2018). Molecular
genetic analysis of the NPC1 and NPC2 genes are required to confirm the diagnosis
of NPC. It is recommended that all patients with a confirmed diagnosis of NPC should
be considered for miglustat. However, miglustat is not recommended in patients with
profound neurological disease since assessment of improvement with therapy would
not be feasible.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of miglustat
capsules. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with
miglustat capsules as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-
term efficacy, approval requires miglustat capsules to be prescribed by or in
consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.
• Zavesca® (miglustat capsules - Actelion, generic)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Gaucher Disease Type 1. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets BOTH of the
following (A and B):
A) The diagnosis is established by ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Demonstration of deficient beta-glucocerebrosidase activity in leukocytes
or fibroblasts; OR
ii. Molecular genetic test showing biallelic pathogenic glucocerebrosidase
(GBA) gene variants; AND

Miglustat Prior Authorization Policy
B) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a geneticist,
endocrinologist, metabolic disorder subspecialist, or a physician who
specializes in the treatment of Gaucher disease or related disorders.
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
2. Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC). Approve for 1 year if the patient meets
ALL of the following (A, B, and C):
A) Patient is ≥ 2 years of age; AND
B) The diagnosis is established by a molecular genetic test showing biallelic
pathogenic variants in either the NPC1 or NPC2 gene; AND
C) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a geneticist,
endocrinologist, metabolic disorder subspecialist, or a physician who
specializes in the treatment of NPC or related disorders.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Zavesca® (miglustat capsules - Actelion, generic)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concomitant Use with Other Approved Therapies for Gaucher Disease.
Concomitant use with other treatments approved for Gaucher disease has not
been evaluated. Of note, examples of medications approved for Gaucher disease
include Cerezyme (imiglucerase intravenous infusion), Elelyso (taliglucerase alfa
intravenous infusion), Vpriv (velaglucerase alfa intravenous infusion), and
Cerdelga (eliglustat capsules).
