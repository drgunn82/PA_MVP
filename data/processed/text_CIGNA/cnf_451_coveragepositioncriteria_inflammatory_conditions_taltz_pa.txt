INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Taltz, an interleukin (IL)-17A antagonist, is indicated for the following uses:1
• Ankylosing spondylitis, in adults with active disease.
• Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, in adults with active disease and
objective signs of inflammation.
• Plaque psoriasis, in patients ≥ 6 years of age with moderate to severe
disease who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.
• Psoriatic arthritis, in adults with active disease.
In the pivotal trial for non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, patients were required
to have objective signs of inflammation, indicated by elevated C-reactive protein
and/or sacroiliitis on magnetic resonance imaging.
Guidelines
Page 1 of 8 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Inflammatory Conditions – Taltz Prior Authorization
Policy
• Spondyloarthritis: Guidelines for ankylosing spondylitis and non-
radiographic axial spondylitis are published by the American College of
Rheumatology (ACR)/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis
Research and Treatment Network (2019).2 Following primary non-response
to a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), either Cosentyx® (secukinumab
subcutaneous injection) or Taltz is recommended; however, if the patient is a
secondary non-responder, a second TNFi is recommended over switching out
of the class. In patients with a contraindication to a TNFi, use of an IL
blocker is recommended over traditional oral agents such as methotrexate or
sulfasalazine.
• Plaque Psoriasis: Joint guidelines from the American Academy of
Dermatology and National Psoriasis Medical Board (2019) have been
published for management of psoriasis with biologics.3 These guidelines list
Taltz as a monotherapy treatment option for patients with moderate to
severe plaque psoriasis. Guidelines from the European Dermatology Forum
(2025) recommend biologics (including Taltz) as second-line therapy for
most patients requiring systemic treatment when there is inadequate
response, contraindication, or intolerance to conventional systemic agents
(e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin).4
• Psoriatic Arthritis: Guidelines from ACR (2019) recommend TNFis over
other biologics for use in treatment-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis and
in those who were previously treated with an oral therapy.5
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Taltz. All
approvals are for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is authorized
in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills required for
evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Taltz as well as the monitoring
required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval requires Taltz to
be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition
being treated.
• Taltz® (ixekizumab subcutaneous injection – Eli Lilly)

met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Taltz® (ixekizumab subcutaneous injection – Eli Lilly)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use a Biologic or with a Targeted Synthetic Oral Small
Molecule Drug. This medication should not be administered in combination with
another biologic or with a targeted synthetic oral small molecule drug used for an
inflammatory condition (see Appendix for examples). Combination therapy is
generally not recommended due to a potentially higher rate of adverse events and
lack of controlled clinical data supporting additive efficacy.
Note: This does NOT exclude the use of methotrexate (a traditional systemic
agent used to treat psoriasis) in combination with this medication.
2. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (i.e., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis).
Exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease, in some cases serious, occurred in
clinical trials with Taltz-treated patients.1
