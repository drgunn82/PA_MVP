CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Bexagliflozin, dapagliflozin, Invokana, Jardiance, and Steglatro are sodium glucose
co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to
improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.1-4 Dapagliflozin,
Invokana, and Jardiance are also indicated in pediatric patients ≥ 10 years of age
with type 2 diabetes as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic
control.1-3
The SGLT-2 inhibitors also possess the following additional indications in patients
with diabetes:
• Jardiance: To reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death in adults with
type 2 diabetes mellitus and established CV disease.
• Invokana: 1) To reduce the risk of major adverse CV events in adults with
type 2 diabetes mellitus and established CV disease; AND 2) To reduce the
risk of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum creatinine, CV death, and
hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and
diabetic nephropathy with albuminuria.
• Dapagliflozin: To reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF)
in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established CV disease or multiple
CV risk factors.
In addition to indications in diabetes, dapagliflozin and Jardiance are indicated
for the following indications in patients with and without diabetes:1,3
• Heart failure, to reduce the risk of CV death, HHF, and urgent heart failure
visits in adults with heart failure (included both reduced and preserved
ejection fraction).
• Chronic kidney disease (CKD), to reduce the risk of sustained estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline, end-stage kidney disease, CV
death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with chronic kidney
disease at risk of progression.
Guidelines
Diabetes
The American Diabetes Association Standards of Care (2025) note that first-line
therapy for type 2 diabetes depends on comorbidities, patient-centered treatment
factors, and management needs.5 The SGLT-2 inhibitors (with demonstrated
benefit) are recommended as initial therapy when pertinent comorbidities are
present (atherosclerotic CV disease, or high CV risk, CKD, and heart failure),
independent of metformin use. In pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes,
metformin is the initial treatment of choice if HbA is < 8.5%; if glycemic goals are
1c
no longer met, Jardiance may be considered in children ≥ 10 years of age (the
updated age indications for dapagliflozin and Invokana are not addressed).
American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) Consensus Statement:
Comprehensive Type 2 Diabetes Management Algorithm (2023) makes similar
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Diabetes – Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter-2 Inhibitors
Step Therapy Policy
recommendations.12 It is noted that an agent with proven benefit should be
utilized; with “proven benefit” referring to a label indication.
Heart Failure
The American College of Cardiology (ACC) Expert Consensus Decision Pathway for
Optimization of Heart Failure Treatment ( 2022) recommends SGLT-2 inhibitors
(dapagliflozin or Jardiance) to reduce HHF and CV mortality, irrespective of the
presence of type 2 diabetes in patients with symptomatic chronic heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction (class 1 recommendation, level of evidence A).6 In
patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, SGLT-2 inhibitors
(Jardiance) can be beneficial in decreasing heart failure hospitalizations and CV
mortality, irrespective of the presence of type 2 diabetes (class 2a
recommendation, level of evidence B-R). Note: This does not reflect the updated
indication for dapagliflozin in patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure.
The ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway on Management of Heart Failure with
Preserved Ejection Fraction (2023) recommends that all individuals with heart
failure with preserved ejection fraction be started on an SGLT-2 inhibitor unless
contraindicated.10 SGLT-2 inhibitors are noted to have demonstrated significant CV
benefits in individuals without type 2 diabetes, particularly in individuals with heart
failure. In such patients, SGLT-2 inhibitors have significantly reduced the risk of
HHF and CV death across all ejection fraction subgroups. Clinical trials with
Jardiance and dapagliflozin are mentioned. For both agents, a significant decrease
in HHF was observed.
The 2023 Focused Update of the 2021 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines
for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Acute and Chronic Heart Failure recommend an
SGLT-2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin or Jardiance) in patients with symptomatic HFmrEF
or HFpEF to reduce the risk of HHF or CV death (Class I, Level A).16 In patients
with type 2 diabetes and CKD, SGLT-2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin or Jardiance) are
recommended to reduce the risk of HHF or CV death (Class I, Level A).
According to the ACC Expert Consensus Decision Pathway for Treatment of Heart
Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction: a Report of the ACC Solution Set Oversight
Committee (2024), guideline-directed medical therapy is the foundation of care in
patients with heart failure and agents with the highest expected benefit should be
prioritized.15 The standard four-drug regimen includes renin-angiotensin inhibitors,
beta-blockers, SGLT inhibitors (i.e., dapagliflozin, Inpefa® [sotaglitflozin tablets],
Jardiance) and mineralocorticoid antagonists. These therapies should be initiated
with a sense of urgency; the optimal time to initiate and/or optimize therapy is
during hospitalization for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.
Kidney Disease
Kidney Diseases Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2024 guidelines for the
clinical evaluation and management of CKD recommend treating patients with type
2 diabetes, CKD, and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 20
mL/min/1.73 m2 with an SGLT-2 inhibitor.13 Once initiated, it is reasonable to
continue the agent, even if the eGFR falls to < 20 mL/min/1.73 m2.
8 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Diabetes – Sodium Glucose Co-Transporter-2 Inhibitors
Step Therapy Policy
In patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease, the KDIGO guidelines for
diabetes management in CKD (2022) recommend first-line pharmacotherapy with
metformin and an SGLT-2 inhibitor with documented kidney or CV benefit
(Invokana, dapagliflozin, and Jardiance).7
Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD)
According to the Guideline for the Management of Lower Extremity PAD from the
ACC/American Heart Association/American Association of Cardiovascular and
Pulmonary Rehabilitation/American Podiatric Medical Association/Association of
Black Cardiologists/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and
Interventions/Society for Vascular Medicine, Society for Vascular Nursing/Society
for Vascular Surgery/Society of Interventional Radiology, and Vascular &
Endovascular Surgery Society (2024), SGLT-2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin, Invokana,
and Jardiance) and some GLP-1 agonists are noted to be effective to reduce the risk
of MACE in patients with type 2 diabetes and PAD.14
