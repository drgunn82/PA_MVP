INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
The following Coverage Policy applies to health benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Certain Cigna
Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make coverage
determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and coverage determinations do not apply to those
clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered
by Cigna Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service
Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan
document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based.
For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a
Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supersedes the information in
the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately
determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance
require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any
applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the
specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical
directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment where appropriate and have discretion in making individual
coverage determinations. Where coverage for care or services does not depend on specific circumstances,
reimbursement will only be provided if a requested service(s) is submitted in accordance with the relevant criteria
outlined in the applicable Coverage Policy, including covered diagnosis and/or procedure code(s). Reimbursement is
not allowed for services when billed for conditions or diagnoses that are not covered under this Coverage Policy (see
"Coding Information" below). When billing, providers must use the most appropriate codes as of the effective date
of the submission. Claims submitted for services that are not accompanied by covered code(s) under the applicable
Coverage Policy will be denied as not covered. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health
benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment
guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other
coverage determinations.

Step Therapy Policy
Cigna National Formulary Coverage:
OVERVIEW
Combined oral contraceptives are sometimes called “the pill” and are one of the
most commonly used forms of contraception.1 Along with the oral tablets, hormonal
contraceptives are also available as transdermal patches and vaginal rings.
Hormonal contraceptives contain a combination of estrogen and progestin or
progestin alone.2 The hormones prevent ovulation and can also prevent fertilized
eggs from implanting in the womb. Estrogens suppress follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH) release from the pituitary, which may block the luteinizing hormone (LH)
surge and prevent ovulation. Progestins provide most of the other contraceptive
effects such as cervical mucus changes, which inhibit sperm penetration and
motility. Progestins also induce endometrial atrophy, which helps to prevent
pregnancy. Oral contraceptives are an effective method of reversible birth control.3
Combined Oral contraceptives (COCs)
COCs are available in monophasic, biphasic, triphasic, or four-phasic combinations.2
The monophasic COCs maintain the same dose of estrogen and progestin
throughout the cycle (21 days of active pills, 7 days of placebo). An extended cycle
84-day monophasic regimen is also available (e.g., Seasonale, generic). The
estrogen and/or progestin doses are varied throughout the cycle for different time
intervals in the bi-, tri-, and four-phasic COCs. All COCs have similar efficacy
irrespective of monophasic or multiphasic regimens. The multiphasic regimens are
generally used to minimize patient specific symptoms (e.g., nausea, breakthrough
bleeding).
Progestin-Only Oral Contraceptives
Progesterone-only products provide an alternative for patients with
contraindications to estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives. Progestin-only
contraceptives may be more favorable in women with certain medical conditions
(e.g., venous thromboembolism) or women who are breastfeeding.4 Most
progesterone-only oral contracepti. contain norethindrone 0.35 mg. Slynd™ is a
progesterone-only oral contraceptive containing drospirenone.6 Drospirenone is
also available as the progesterone component of numerous oral contraceptives
containing ethinyl estradiol. Because drospirenone has antimineralocorticoid
activity, drospirenone-containing products are contraindicated in patients with
conditions which predispose them to hyperkalemia, including renal disease, hepatic
dysfunction, and adrenal insufficiency.
Transdermal Patches
Ortho Evra® and its generics, Xulane® and Zafemy™, are transdermal patches
composed of ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin (35 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 150
mcg norelgestromin released every 24 hours).5,8 The brand, Ortho Evra, was
discontinued in 2015 by the manufacturer, but the generics are still available. The
only other transdermal contraceptive patch is Twirla®, composed of ethinyl estradiol
and levonorgestrel (30 mcg ethinyl estradiol and 120 mcg levonorgestrel released
every 24 hours).7 Both transdermal patches are contraindicated (Boxed Warning)
Page 7 of 9 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Contraceptives – Oral, Patch, and Vaginal Ring Products
Step Therapy Policy
for use in women with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m2.5,7 Generics for Ortho
Evra have a limitation of use that it may be less effective in preventing pregnancy
in women who weigh more than 198 pounds (90 kg).5,8 Twirla has a limitation of
use to consider the reduced effectiveness in women with a BMI ≥ 25 to < 30
kg/m2.7 Generic Ortho Evra products also have additional warnings in the labeling
regarding higher estrogen exposure compared with oral contraceptives containing
ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg.5,8
Vaginal Rings
NuvaRing® and its generics, etonogestrel-ethinyl estradiol, EluRyng™, EnilloRing®,
and Haloette®, are vaginal rings indicated to prevent pregnancy.9,11,12 These
products are disposable rings; one ring used continuously for 3 weeks, followed by
a 1-week ring-free interval. Annovera® is a reusable ring with one ring providing
contraception for 13 cycles.10 The cycles are 3 weeks with vaginal ring inserted and
1 week with the vaginal ring removed. Annovera contains ethinyl estradiol and
segesterone acetate.
POLICY STATEMENT
This program has been developed to encourage the use of a Step 1 Product prior to
the use of a Step 2 Product. If the Step Therapy rule is not met for a Step 2 Product
at the point of service, coverage will be determined by the Step Therapy criteria
below. All approvals are provided for 1 year in duration.
Note: When compliance with the Affordable Care Act, Health Resources and
Services Administration Guidelines, and Public Health Services Act section 2713 is
required and the conditions for coverage listed under the Criteria are not met,
approval is granted when the requested drug is used for the prevention of
pregnancy or for the improvement of birth outcomes and, according to the
prescriber, the alternative Step 1 Products would not be as medically appropriate
for the patient as the requested drug.
Step 1: Generic oral contraceptives, transdermal Xulane, transdermal Zafemy,
etonogestrel-ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring, Eluryng vaginal ring, EnilloRing
vaginal ring, Haloette vaginal ring
Step 2: Brand oral contraceptives, transdermal Twirla, NuvaRing, Annovera,
Femlyv
Contraceptives – Oral, Patch, and Vaginal Ring Products product(s) is(are)
covered as medically necessary when the following step therapy criteria
is(are) met. Any other exception is considered not medically necessary.
CRITERIA
1. If the patient has tried one Step 1 Product, approve a Step 2 Product.
