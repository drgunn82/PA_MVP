CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Mavyret, a direct-acting antiviral, contains glecaprevir, a pangenotypic NS3/4A protease
inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a pangenotypic NS5A inhibitor.1 It is indicated for the treatment
of acute or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) in patients ≥ 3 years of age with genotype 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis (Child-Pugh A). It
is indicated in patients ≥ 3 years of age with genotype 1 infection who have previously been
treated with a regimen containing an HCV NS5A inhibitor or an NS3/4A protease inhibitor,
but not both.
Dosing
The duration of therapy is based on prior treatment experience, genotype, and the presence
or absence of cirrhosis (see Tables 1 and 2). In addition, Mavyret is recommended for 12
weeks in patients ≥ 3 years of age who are liver or kidney transplant recipients. Similar to
non-transplant recipients, a 16-week treatment duration is recommended in genotype 1-
infected patients who are NS5A inhibitor-experienced without prior treatment with an
NS3/4A protease inhibitor or in genotype 3-infected patients who are treatment-experienced
with regimens containing interferon, pegylated interferon, ribavirin, and/or Sovaldi®

(sofosbuvir tablets/oral pellets). The clinical trial in patients with acute HCV assessed
Mavyret for 8 weeks.

Sovaldi, or Olysio, Victrelis® (boceprevir capsules), or Incivek® (telaprevir tablets) with
interferon or pegylated interferon and ribavirin were studied; 2 Regimens containing
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or Daklinza® (daclatasvir tablets) + pegylated interferon + ribavirin
[unapproved regimen] were studied.
Efficacy in Acute HCV
The efficacy of Mavyret in patients with acute HCV was evaluated in a single-arm, open-
label study in adults who were treatment-naïve for their current infection (n = 286).1 All
patients received Mavyret for 8 weeks. Eligible patients had a diagnosis of acute HCV
infection at screening defined as physician diagnosis, quantifiable HCV RNA, and one or
more of the following: Recent conversion of negative to positive results in anti-HCV
antibody, HCV RNA, or HCV core antigen testing; liver disease signs associated with acute
HCV infection1; and recent risk behaviors for HCV infection1 within the past 6 months4. In
addition, patients either had compensated cirrhosis or did not have cirrhosis.4 Among the
enrolled patients, 84% had evidence of clinical hepatitis at screening in the absence of other
causes of liver disease and with recent risk behavior for HCV transmission.1 At baseline
96% of patients had quantifiable HCV RNA; 39% of these patients had a documented result
of negative HCV antibody or unquantifiable HCV RNA within the prior 1 year, and 4% of
whom had unquantifiable HCV RNA (potentially reflecting spontaneous clearance of the HCV
infection during the pretreatment period). A prior history of HCV infection was reported in
18% of patients; 2% of patients had cirrhosis. Most patients had genotype 1 HCV (58%);
4% of patients had genotype 2, 12% had genotype 3, and 17% had genotype 4. The
overall rate of SVR12 was 96%; no patient had virologic failure.
Guidelines
9 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Hepatitis C – Mavyret Prior Authorization Policy
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases/Infectious Diseases Society of
America (AASLD/IDSA) provide recommendations for testing, monitoring, and treating HCV
(December 19, 2023).2 The guidelines have not been updated since the approval of
Mavyret in acute HCV infection.
Patients with acute infection should be treated upon initial diagnosis (defined as quantifiable
HCV RNA) without awaiting spontaneous resolution.2 Owing to high efficacy and safety, the
same regimens that are recommended for chronic HCV infection are recommended for acute
infection. At the time the recommendation was made, the guidelines note that there were
insufficient evidence to support a particular regimen or treatment duration outside of a
clinical trial. Pangenotypic regimens are recommended if HCV genotyping is not available or
if a concern of exposure to more than one genotype exists. Additionally, the guidelines
state that using the same regimens to treat acute or recent HCV as for chronic HCV also
simplifies management as defining acute HCV may be clinically challenging.
Instances in which the guidelines provide recommendations for Mavyret outside of the FDA-
approved indications are outlined below.
With the availability of pangenotypic HCV treatment regimens, HCV genotyping is no longer
required prior to treatment initiation for all individuals. Pretreatment genotyping is still
recommended in patients with cirrhosis and/or past unsuccessful HCV treatment, because
treatment regimens may differ by genotype. However, for treatment-naïve patients without
cirrhosis, although genotyping may impact on the preferred treatment approach, it is not
required if a pangenotypic regimen is used. Treatment-naïve adults without cirrhosis are
eligible for simplified treatment if they do not have hepatitis B virus (not hepatitis B serum
antigen [HBsAg] positive), are not pregnant, do not have hepatocellular carcinoma, and
have not had a liver transplantation. In treatment-naïve adults without cirrhosis, the
recommended regimens are Mavyret for 8 weeks or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks.
Additional genotype-specific and/or special circumstance-specific recommendations are also
provided for patients falling outside of these parameters. Treatment-naïve adults with
compensated cirrhosis are also eligible for simplified treatment. In patients with
compensated cirrhosis, the recommended regimen in patients with genotype 1 through 6 is
Mavyret for 8 weeks; sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks is recommended in patients with
genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 (patients with genotype 3 require baseline NS5A resistance-
associated substitution testing. Those without Y93H can be treated with
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for 12 weeks). Genotype testing is not required for Mavyret as part
of the simplified algorithm in patients with compensated cirrhosis.
Mavyret is recognized as a recommended regimen (12 weeks) for the treatment of patients
with recurrent HCV post-liver transplantation (without cirrhosis or with compensated
cirrhosis).
The European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition
recommendations on the treatment of hepatitis C (2024) describe the optimal therapeutic
management of adolescents and children with HCV infection.3 Direct-acting antiviral
regimens are recommended for all treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced children ≥ 3
years of age with chronic HCV. When available, the regimen of choice should be one that
has the shortest treatment duration and does not require concomitant ribavirin. In addition,
to simplify treatment and avoid the need of genotyping and/or baseline resistance‐
associated substitutions assessment, pangenotypic regimens are preferred. In children and
adolescents without cirrhosis, or with compensated cirrhosis, recommended regimens are
Mavyret, sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. In children and adolescents with
decompensated cirrhosis, treatment should follow adult guidelines.

POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Mavyret. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Mavyret as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and efficacy, approval requires Mavyret to be
prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being
treated.
