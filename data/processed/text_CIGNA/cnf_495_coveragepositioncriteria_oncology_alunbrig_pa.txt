INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Alunbrig, a kinase inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK)-positive, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults,
as detected by an FDA-approved test.1
Guidelines
Alunbrig is addressed in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)
guidelines:2-5
• Histiocytic Neoplasms: Guidelines (version 1.2025 – June 20, 2025)
recommend Alunbrig as a “Useful in Certain Circumstances” treatment option
for ALK-positive Erdheim-Chester disease (category 2A).3
• Inflammatory Myofibroblastic Tumor (IMT): NCCN Soft Tissue Sarcoma
guidelines (version 1.2025 – May 2, 2025) recommend Alunbrig as a
“Preferred” treatment option for IMT with ALK translocation (category 2A). The
Page 1 of 4: Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Oncology (Oral – Anaplastic
Lymphoma Kinase [ALK]-Positive Agent) - Alunbrig Prior Authorization Policy
NCCN Uterine Neoplasms guidelines (version 3.2025 – March 7, 2025)
recommend Alunbrig as “Useful in Certain Circumstances” for first-line therapy
for advanced, recurrent/metastatic, or inoperable IMT with ALK translocation
for uterine sarcoma (category 2A).5,6
• NSCLC: Guidelines (version 7.2025 – July 10, 2025) recommend testing for
ALK rearrangements in eligible patients with NSCLC.4 If ALK rearrangement is
discovered prior to first-line systemic therapy, Alunbrig is a “Preferred” first-
line treatment option (category 1). If ALK rearrangement is discovered during
first-line systemic therapy, options are to complete the planned systemic
therapy (including maintenance therapy) or to interrupt the systemic therapy
and treat with Alunbrig (“Preferred”, category 2A) or another ALK inhibitor.
NCCN recommendations for patients with disease progression often include
continuing the first-line targeted therapy, depending on type of progression.
• T-Cell Lymphomas: Guidelines (version 2.2025 – May 28, 2025) recommend
Alunbrig for ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) under “other
recommended regimens” (category 2A) for initial palliative-intent therapy and
for second-line/subsequent therapy (regardless of intention to transplant).7
