INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Benlysta subcutaneous, a B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS)-specific inhibitor, is indicated for
the following uses:1
• Lupus nephritis, in patients ≥ 5 years of age with active disease who are receiving
standard therapy.
• Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in patients ≥ 5 years of age with active
disease who are receiving standard therapy.
Limitations of Use: Benlysta has not been studied and is not recommended in patients with
severe, active central nervous system lupus.1
The efficacy of Benlysta for the treatment of SLE was studied in patients with a history of
autoantibodies (anti-nuclear antibodies and/or anti-double-stranded DNA) and an
exploratory analysis of the pivotal trial indicated Benlysta was beneficial in patients who
were autoantibody positive.1
Of note, intravenous Benlysta is not targeted in this policy.

Policy
Guidelines
Guidelines for the management of lupus nephritis from Kidney Disease: Improving Global
Outcomes (KDIGO) [2024] recommendations include Benlysta or Lupkynis in combination
with other medications plus glucocorticoids as initial treatment options for patients with
active Class III or IV biopsy confirmed lupus nephritis (strong recommendation, moderate
certainty of evidence).3 No preference is given between the treatment protocol options;
however, the KDIGO guidelines do provide individual patient clinical factors to consider,
including but not limited to, kidney function and histology, risk of disease flare, proteinuria,
background suppression, and need for parenteral therapy.
Guidelines from American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [2024] for treatment of lupus
nephritis in patients with active/new onset/flare of Class III/IV (with or without Class V)
conditionally recommend triple combination regimens as first line (continuous) therapy with
glucocorticoids + one of the following options: mycophenolic acid analogs (MPAA) +
Benlysta; or MPAA + calcineurin inhibitor (e.g. Lupkynis); or low-dose cyclophosphamide +
Benlysta.5 For patients with extra-renal manifestations, a triple combination regimen with
Benlysta is preferred over other alternatives.
European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines for SLE (2023 update)
recommend hydroxychloroquine for all patients, unless contraindicated.2 Depending on the
type and severity of organ involvement, glucocorticoids can be used but dosing should be
minimized or withdrawn when possible. Methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, and/or
biologic agents (Benlysta, Saphnelo® [anifrolumab-fnia intravenous infusion]) should be
considered in patients who do not respond to hydroxychloroquine ± glucocorticoids. EULAR
also states biologic agents (Benlysta, Saphnelo) should be considered as second-line
therapy for the treatment of patients with active skin disease. Patients with active
proliferative lupus nephritis should also consider combination therapy with biologic agents
(Benlysta, Lupkynis™ [voclosporin capsules]). In general, the pharmacological interventions
should be directed by patient specific characteristics and the type/severity of organ
involvement.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Benlysta
subcutaneous. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the
approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Benlysta subcutaneous
as well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Benlysta subcutaneous to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Benlysta® (belimumab subcutaneous injection – GlaxoSmithKline)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are) met for
FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence (if applicable):

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Benlysta® (belimumab subcutaneous injection – GlaxoSmithKline)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including the
following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as newly
published data are available):
1. Concurrent Use with Other Biologics. Benlysta has not been studied and is not
recommended in combination with other biologics.1 Safety and efficacy have not been
established with these combinations. See APPENDIX for examples of biologics that
should not be taken in combination with Benlysta.
2. Concurrent Use with Lupkynis (voclosporin capsules). Lupkynis has not been
studied in combination with biologics such as Benlysta.1
3. Rheumatoid Arthritis. A Phase II dose-ranging study evaluating patients with
rheumatoid arthritis showed only small American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20
responses with Benlysta (e.g., ACR 20 response at Week 24 was 28% with Benlysta 10
mg/kg).5 Numerous other agents are available with higher ACR responses and
established efficacy for rheumatoid arthritis.
