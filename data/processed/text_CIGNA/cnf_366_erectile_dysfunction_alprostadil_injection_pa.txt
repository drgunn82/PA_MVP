CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Caverject, Caverject Impulse, Edex, and Muse are indicated for the treatment of
erectile dysfunction due to neurogenic, vasculogenic, psychogenic, or mixed
etiology.1-4 Additionally, Caverject may be used as an adjunct to other diagnostic
tests in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.1 Injectable alprostadil products include
Caverject, Caverject Impulse (disposable, single-dose, dual chamber syringe
system), and Edex.1-3 MUSE is available as a single-use, medicated transurethral
system for the delivery of alprostadil directly in the urethra.4 MUSE is administered
by inserting the applicator stem into the urethra after urination.1
These products have also been studied for penile rehabilitation.5 Alprostadil may help
the recovery of erectile function by promotion of cavernosal oxygenation levels.
Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of alprostadil injections and MUSE for
early penile rehabilitation post-radical prostatectomy.6-12
