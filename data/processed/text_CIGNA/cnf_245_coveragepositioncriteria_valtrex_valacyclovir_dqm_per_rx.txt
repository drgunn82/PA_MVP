COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA

▪ Treatment in immunocompetent patients (initial or recurrent episode).
▪ Suppression in immunocompetent or patients with human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection.

o Herpes zoster
▪ Treatment in immunocompetent patients.
• Pediatric Patients:

of age.
Page 1 of 7 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Antivirals – Valacyclovir Drug Quantity Management
Policy – Per Rx
o Treatment of chickenpox, immunocompetent pediatric patients 2 to < 18 years
of age.
The efficacy and safety of valacyclovir has not been established in
immunocompromised patients other than for the suppression of genital herpes in
patients with HIV-1.1

Off-Label Dosing
There are data and/or guidelines to support several off-label uses of valacyclovir.
Quantity limits for valacyclovir (Valtrex, generic) provide for 30 tablets per
7 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Antivirals – Valacyclovir Drug Quantity Management
Policy – Per Rx
dispensing at retail or 90 tablets per dispensing at home delivery. This provides a
quantity sufficient for the majority of labeled and off-label doses. Below are
situations where additional quantities of valacyclovir may be needed.
• Cytomegalovirus (CMV): For the prevention of CMV infection following solid
organ transplantation (renal), the recommended dose of valacyclovir is 2 grams
four times daily (QID).2 Valacyclovir is not recommended as an option for
prophylaxis in patients receiving heart, liver, pancreas, lung, intestinal, and
composite tissue transplant. In hematopoietic cell transplant recipients,
valacyclovir is also an option for CMV prophylaxis, with dosing ranging from 1
gram twice daily (BID) to 2 grams three times daily (TID), depending on the
setting in which it is used.3
• Herpes simplex virus (HSV):
o Immunocompromised patients: In adults and adolescents with HIV,
valacyclovir 500 mg BID is recommended for chronic suppression of HSV.4
Valacyclovir 500 mg BID is also recommended for the prevention of HSV in
immunocompromised patients who have undergone solid organ transplant
who are not already receiving CMV prophylaxis, as well as in HSV-
seropositive hematopoietic cell transplant recipients.3,5 In this same
population in patients with severe mucocutaneous HSV, after initial
intravenous (IV) therapy, oral therapy can be used as oral lesions begin to
regress (valacyclovir 1 gram BID continued until lesions are completely
healed).
o Pregnant patients: For the suppression of HSV in a pregnant patient who has
experienced a genital HSV lesion anytime during pregnancy, valacyclovir 500
mg BID starting at 36 weeks gestation and continued until delivery is a
recommended alternative agent.6
• Herpes zoster (shingles):
o Treatment: In adults and adolescents with HIV, guidelines recommend
valacyclovir 1 gram TID for 7 to 10 days (or longer if lesions are slow to
resolve) for the treatment of acute, localized, dermatomal herpes zoster
(shingles).4 Valacyclovir has been used for the treatment of localized herpes
zoster (dermatomal) in solid organ transplant recipients at a dose of 1 gram
TID for 7 days, or until lesions have crusted over which may be delayed in
immunocompromised hosts.7
o Prophylaxis: Refer to details in the VZV prophylaxis section below.
• Varicella zoster virus (VZV) [chickenpox]:
o Treatment: In adults and adolescents with HIV, guidelines recommend
valacyclovir 1 gram TID for 5 to 7 days for the treatment of uncomplicated
cases of primary VZV infection (chickenpox).4 For severe or complicated
cases, patients are treated with IV therapy and are then transitioned to oral
therapy with valacyclovir 1 gram TID after defervescence if no evidence of
visceral involvement is notes is noted. Similar dosing is recommended in
solid organ transplant recipients.7
o Prophylaxis: For the short-term (3 to 6 months) prophylaxis of VZV or
herpes zoster in solid organ transplant recipients who are HSV- or VZV-
seropositive and not receiving CMV prophylaxis, valacyclovir 500 mg BID has
been used.7 It may also be considered in seronegative recipients. In
hematopoietic cell transplant recipients who are VZV-seropositive, the
7 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Antivirals – Valacyclovir Drug Quantity Management
Policy – Per Rx
recommended dose of valacyclovir is also 500 mg BID for 1 year following
transplantation.3 The duration may be extended in patients who require
ongoing immunosuppression.
• Viral ophthalmic infections: Valacyclovir is recommended for the treatment of
acute retinal necrosis, an ophthalmic reactivation of herpes zoster virus,
following initial treatment with IV acyclovir.8 Recommended doses range from 1
gram TID to 2 grams QID. In adults and adolescents with HIV and acute retinal
necrosis, recommended treatment is acyclovir IV for 10 to 14 days, followed by
oral valacyclovir 1 gram TID for 14 weeks or longer.4 Valacyclovir has also been
used for the management of herpes simplex keratitis at a dose of 500 mg TID
for 2 weeks.9
Availability
Valacyclovir is available in 500 mg and 1,000 mg (1 gram) tablets.1 Valacyclovir
oral suspension (25 mg/mL or 50 mg/mL) may be prepared extemporaneously from
500 mg valacyclovir tablets for use in pediatric patients for whom a solid dosage
form is not appropriate.
POLICY STATEMENT
This Drug Quantity Management program has been developed to promote dose
consolidation of valacyclovir. If the Drug Quantity Management rule is not met for
the requested medication at the point of service, coverage will be determined by
the Criteria below. All approvals are provided for 1 year in duration.
