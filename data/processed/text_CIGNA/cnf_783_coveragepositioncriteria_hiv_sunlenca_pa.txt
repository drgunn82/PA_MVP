INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES
ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS,
DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Sunlenca, a human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) capsid inhibitor, is indicated in
combination with other antiretroviral(s) for the treatment of multidrug resistant
HIV-1 infection in heavily treatment-experienced adults failing their current
antiretroviral regimen due to resistance, intolerance, or safety considerations.1 Of
note, Sunlenca is also available as tablets which are not addressed in this policy.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Sunlenca was evaluated in one Phase II/III, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multicenter, pivotal study in patients with multidrug resistant
HIV-1.2 Eligible patients had documented resistance to two or more agents from
three of four main antiretroviral classes (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
[NRTI], non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [NNRTI], protease inhibitor,
and integrase strand-transfer inhibitor [INSTI]) and two or fewer active
antiretrovirals from the four main classes that could be effectively combined for
optimized background therapy.
Guidelines
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Human Immunodeficiency Virus – Sunlenca Prior
Authorization Policy
According to the Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines (September
12, 2024) for the use of antiviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV infection,
treatment-experienced patients with ongoing detectable viremia who lack sufficient
treatment options to construct a fully suppressive regimen may be candidates for
Trogarzo® (ibalizumab-uiyk intravenous infusion), Rukobia™ (fostemsavir extended-
release tablets), or Sunlenca.4 Patients who continue to have detectable viremia and
who lack sufficient treatment options to construct a fully suppressive regimen may
also be candidates for research studies or expanded access programs, or they may
qualify for single-patient access to an investigational new drug as specified in FDA
regulations. The goal of therapy is viral resuppression, if possible; otherwise, to keep
the viral load as low as possible and CD4 T-cell count as high as possible. The CD4
T-cell count is used to assess a patient’s immunologic response to treatment. CD4 T-
cell count is recommended to be monitored at entry into care, when switching or
modifying ARVs, and then every 3, 6, or 12 months depending on CD4 T-cell count
and the duration of viral suppression. The CD4 T-cell count response to ARV therapy
varies widely, but a poor CD4 T-cell response in a patient with viral suppression is
rarely an indication for modifying a treatment regimen. For people with multidrug-
resistant HIV-2, Trogarzo and Sunlenca may be considered based on in vitro data.
Optimal treatment strategies for individuals with HIV-2 are not defined.
The International Antiviral Society-USA (December 2024) provides some guidance
on patients with viral failure.5 In individuals with virologic failure with extensive
multiclass resistance (including to INSTIs), agents with novel mechanisms of action
such Rukobia, Trogarzo, or Sunclenca are recommended, ideally in combination to
allow for two fully active drugs.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Sunlenca. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Sunlenca as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Sunlenca to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in
the condition being treated.
• Sunlenca® (lenacapavir tablets and subcutaneous injection (Gilead)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
