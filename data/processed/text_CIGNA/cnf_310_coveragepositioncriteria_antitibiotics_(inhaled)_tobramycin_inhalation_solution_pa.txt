CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
The tobramycin inhalation solutions are aminoglycoside antibiotics indicated for the
management of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.1-3 TOBI
(generic) and Kitabis (authorized generic) are indicated for the management of CF in
patients ≥ 6 years of age.1,2 Safety and efficacy have not been demonstrated in patients <
6 years of age, patients with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) < 25% or > 75%
1
predicted, or patients colonized with Burkholderia cepacia. Bethkis (generic) is indicated for
the management of CF patients with P. aeruginosa.3 Safety and efficacy have not been
demonstrated in patients < 6 years of age, patients with FEV < 40% or > 80% predicted,
1
or patients colonized with B. cepacia.
Guidelines
The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) Pulmonary Therapeutics Committee published
recommendations for the use of chronic medications in the management of CF lung disease
(2013).4 In patients ≥ 6 years of age with CF and moderate-to-severe lung disease with P.
aeruginosa persistently present in cultures of the airways, chronic use of inhaled tobramycin
is strongly recommended to improve lung function and quality of life, and reduce
exacerbations. For mild disease, the Committee recommends chronic use of inhaled

Prior Authorization Policy
tobramycin for patients ≥ 6 years of age with CF and P. aeruginosa persistently present in
cultures of the airways, to reduce exacerbations.
The CFF published a systematic review of the literature regarding eradication of initial P.
aeruginosa infections to develop guidelines for effective prevention (2014).5 The
recommendations pertaining to inhaled antibiotics are as follows: 1) Inhaled antibiotic
therapy is recommended for the treatment of initial or new growth of P. aeruginosa (the
favored antibiotic regimen is tobramycin [300 mg twice daily {BID}] for 28 days); and 2).
Prophylactic antipseudomonal antibiotics to prevent the acquisition of P. aeruginosa are not
recommended.
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
A few trials support the efficacy of tobramycin inhalation solution (TIS) for the treatment of
bronchiectasis with P. aeruginosa infection. A literature review concluded that in patients
with non-CF bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection, TIS is effective in reducing
the density of bacteria in sputum, which may be associated with additional clinical benefit.12
In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, patients received either TIS 300
mg (n = 37) or placebo (n = 37) BID for 4 weeks and were followed for an additional 2
weeks off treatment.6 At Week 4, the TIS group had a mean 4.54 log decrease in P.
10
aeruginosa colony-forming units (CFU)/g of sputum compared with no change in the placebo
group (P < 0.01). At Week 6, complete eradication of P. aeruginosa occurred in 35% of the
patients in the TIS group compared with none in the placebo group, and 62% of patients in
the TIS group vs. 38% of patients in the placebo group had improvements in their general
health (odds ratio 2.7; 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 6.9).
In a randomized, single-blind study, patients received TIS 300 mg (n = 16) or placebo (n =
19) BID for 3 months following a 14-day course of intravenous ceftazidime and tobramycin
and were followed for an additional 12 months.7 At the end of the study, 54.5% of patients
in the TIS group (n = 6/11) and 29.4% of patients in the placebo group (n = 5/17) were
free of P. aeruginosa (P = 0.048). In addition, patients in the TIS group had significantly
fewer exacerbations (1.27 vs. 2.5; P = 0.044), hospital admissions (0.06 vs. 0.47; P =
0.037), and hospital days (0.9 vs. 13.56; P = 0.034) than patients in the placebo group,
respectively. No significant differences were found in pulmonary function tests.
A double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study randomized 30 patients to initial TIS
300 mg or placebo BID for 6 months, followed by a 1 month washout period and 6 months
of therapy with the other treatment.8 During the first treatment period, TIS treatment
resulted in a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa density compared with placebo (P =
0.038). During both treatment periods, patients treated with TIS had fewer hospital
admissions (0.15 vs. 0.75; P = 0.038) and hospital days (2.05 vs. 12.65; P = 0.047) than
patients treated with placebo, respectively. No significant changes in the number of
exacerbations and/or pulmonary function tests were observed.
In an open-label trial, 41 patients received three cycles of TIS 300 mg BID for 14 days
followed by 14 days off therapy.9 Patients were followed for an additional 40 weeks after the
three cycles of treatment with TIS. At Week 10, there was a significant improvement from
baseline (mean change 1.5 points; P = 0.006) in the composite pulmonary symptom score
which included cough, shortness of breath, sputum production, fatigue, and wheezing.
Quality of life, assessed using the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, was significantly
improved at Week 10 (mean change 9.8; P < 0.001) compared with baseline. At Week 12,
4 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Antibiotics (Inhaled) – Tobramycin Inhalation Solution Prior
Authorization Policy
22.2% of patients (n = 6/27) were considered to have P. aeruginosa eradicated from
sputum cultures.
A Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial randomized adults with
symptomatic bronchiectasis with positive P. aeruginosa sputum culture to TIS 300 mg (n =
167) or placebo (n = 172) in addition to standard of care.13 Treatment was provided for two
cycles, each consisting of 28 days on therapy and 28 days off therapy. At Week 16, there
was a significant reduction in P. aeruginosa density with TIS vs. placebo (adjusted
difference 1.74 log CFU/g; P < 0.001) and a greater improvement in the quality of life
10
bronchiectasis respiratory symptom score on Day 29 (adjusted mean difference 7.91; P <
0.001). Significantly more patients were culture-negative for P. aeruginosa in the TIS group
vs. placebo on Day 29 (29.3% vs. 10.6%, respectively).
The American Thoracic Society (ATS) published a clinical review (2013) of non-cystic fibrosis
bronchiectasis.10 The review lists nebulized antibiotics (e.g., colistin, gentamicin,
tobramycin) as treatment options for the eradication or suppression of P. aeruginosa. The
European Respiratory Society (ERS) have published guidelines (2017) for the management
of adult bronchiectasis and recommends patients with a new isolate of P. aeruginosa be
offered eradication antibiotic treatment which includes nebulized antibiotics (e.g., colistin,
gentamicin, tobramycin).11 While both the ATS and ERS list nebulized colistin and
gentamicin as treatment options for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, neither drug has a
commercially available formulation for nebulization.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of tobramycin
inhalation solution. All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where
the approval is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the
specialized skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with tobramycin
