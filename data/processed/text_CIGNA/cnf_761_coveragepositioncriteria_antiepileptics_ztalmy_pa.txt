INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ztalmy, a neuroactive steroid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor positive
modulator, is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with cyclin-
dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder (CDD) in patients ≥ 2
years of age.1
Disease Overview
CDD is a rare, X-linked developmental epileptic encephalopathy caused by variants
in the CDKL5 gene.2,3 This disorder can manifest in a broad range of clinical
symptoms, including early-onset (< 3 months of age in 90% of patients [median of
5 weeks]), hypotonia, intractable epilepsy, and neurodevelopmental delay
impacting cognitive, motor, speech, and visual function. Both cognitive impairment
and refractory epilepsy in individuals with CDD are particularly severe; less than
50% of patients have reported a period of seizure freedom > 2 months, with only
12% of patients experiencing seizure freedom for > 12 months. The CDKL5 gene

Policy
provides instructions for making proteins that are essential for normal brain and
neuron development. The CDKL5 protein acts as a kinase, an enzyme that changes
the activity of other proteins by adding a phosphate group at specific positions;
however, it has not yet been determined which proteins are targeted by the CDKL5
protein. Many cases of CDD have been identified in boys, but because of the
location of the gene on the X chromosome, CDD primarily affects girls. Ztalmy is
the first antiseizure medication that is FDA-approved for use in CDD and has been
prospectively studied.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Ztalmy in patients with molecularly confirmed CDD was evaluated in
one pivotal trial called the Marigold Study (n = 101).4 Eligible patients were 2 to 21
years of age and had a molecularly confirmed CDKL5 variant that was considered
pathogenic or likely to be pathogenic. Patients could remain on a regimen of up to
four concomitant antiseizure medications during the trial, including (but not limited
to) valproate, levetiracetam, clobazam, and vigabatrin. During the 17-week double-
blind phase, the median 28-day major motor seizure frequency was 45.0 in the
Ztalmy arm vs. 55.5 in the placebo arm. Compared with the 6-week baseline
period, the median percentage change in 28-day major motor seizure frequency
was statistically significantly improved (reduced) in the Ztalmy arm vs. the placebo
arm (-30.7% vs. -6.9%, respectively; P = 0.0036).
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Ztalmy. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Ztalmy as well
as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires Ztalmy to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
