CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Addyi is indicated for the treatment of premenopausal women with acquired,
generalized hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) that is characterized
by low sexual desire that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty and is
NOT due to a co-existing medical or psychiatric condition; problems within the
relationship; or the effects of a medication or other drug substance.1
Addyi is not indicated for the treatment of HSDD in postmenopausal women or in
men. It is also not indicated to enhance sexual performance. The prescribing
information notes that Addyi should be discontinued after 8 weeks if the patient
does not report any improvement in HSDD symptoms.1 In the Addyi clinical
studies, one of the coprimary efficacy endpoints was assessed by the median
increase in the number of satisfying sexual events standardized over a 28-day
period.
Safety
Addyi contains a Boxed Warning regarding the use of alcohol and the increase in
risk of severe hypotension and syncope.1 Patients should be counseled to wait at
least two hours after consuming one or two standard alcoholic drinks before taking

Authorization Policy
Addyi or skip the dose if they have consumed three or more standard alcoholic
drinks that evening.
Guidelines
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists guideline on Female
Sexual Dysfunction (2019) notes the importance of recognizing if the loss of sexual
interest is due to a co-morbid or undiagnosed condition, or medication.4 The
guidelines note that Addyi was approved in 2015 by the FDA to treatment
hypoactive sexual desire disorder in premenopausal women without depression.
Addyi is noted as a treatment option for HSDD in premenopausal women without
depression who are appropriately counseled about the risk of alcohol use during
treatment.4 The guidelines also discuss that systemic review and meta-analysis of
existing studies with Addyi show that although the studies were randomized, their
overall quality of evidence for efficacy and safety was very low.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
Addyi™ (flibanserin tablets ( Sprout)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria
will be updated as new published data are available):
1. Postmenopausal Patients. Two published Phase III trials assessed the
efficacy of Addyi in postmenopausal women with HSDD.2,3 In the SNOWDROP
trial though there was statistical significance in the primary endpoints (number
of satisfying sexual events over 28 days and increase in desire score), the
treatment difference between Addyi and placebo was very minimal.2 The
PLUMERIA study was discontinued early by the study sponsor for commercial
reasons; however, published data are available for up to Week 16.3 The
improvement from baseline to Week 16 in the Female Sexual Function Index
desire domain was significantly greater with Addyi compared with placebo, but
the other co-primary endpoint of sexually satisfying events was not significantly
different between Addyi and placebo. Addyi is currently not approved for use in
postmenopausal women with HSDD/FSIAD symptoms.
