CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Tarpeyo, a corticosteroid, is indicated to reduce the loss of kidney function in adults
with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) at risk of rapid disease
progression.1
The recommended dose is 16 mg orally once daily (QD) at least 1 hour before a meal
for 9 months.1 When discontinuing therapy, the dose is reduced to 8 mg QD for the
last 2 weeks of therapy. Safety and efficacy of treatment with subsequent courses
of Tarpeyo have not been established.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Tarpeyo was evaluated in one pivotal, 9-month trial (with 15 month
observational follow-up [see below]) in patients ≥ 18 years of age with IgAN.1,2,4
Eligible patients had biopsy-proven IgAN, proteinuria (defined as either ≥ 1 g/day)
or a urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 0.8 g/g despite optimized supportive
care, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 35 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ≤
90 mL/min/1.73 m2.2,4 Optimized supportive care required that patients receive the
maximum tolerated or maximum allowed dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme
inhibitor and/or angiotensin II type I receptor blocker for ≥ 3 months prior to
randomization and continue the agent throughout the trial. Tarpeyo resulted in
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Nephrology – Tarpeyo Prior Authorization Policy
statistically greater reduction in UPCR and less eGFR decline relative to placebo after
9 months of treatment.2
Following the 9-month randomized, treatment period, patients were followed for 15
months during an observational period in which no study medication was
administered.4 During the observational study period, all patients remained on
optimized supportive care. At Year 2, the time-weighted average of eGFR (primary
endpoint) showed a statistically significant treatment benefit in patients who received
Tarpeyo vs. placebo (-2.47 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs. -7.52 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively;
P < 0.0001 for the difference). At the end of the original study period (Month 9), the
mean change in eGFR in the Tarpeyo and placebo groups was +0.66 mL/min/1.73
m2 and -4.56 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively; the eGFR benefit was maintained during
the 15 month observational period. At Year 2, the change in eGFR from baseline was
-6.11 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the Tarpeyo group vs. -12.00 mL/min/1.73 m2 in the
placebo group corresponding to a difference in the 2-year total eGFR slope
(supportive endpoint) of 2.95 mL/min/1.73 m2/year (P < 0.0001). This represented
approximately 50% less deterioration of kidney function in patients receiving Tarpeyo
vs. placebo over the 2 year period. The 2-year eGFR treatment effect was consistent
across subgroups including the baseline proteinuria and UPCR subgroups (< 1.5 g/g
or ≥ 1.5 g/g). Time from randomization to confirmed 30% reduction eGFR or kidney
failure (secondary endpoint) was significantly delayed with Tarpeyo vs. placebo (12%
of patients vs. 21% of patients, respectively; hazard ratio [HR] 0.45; 95% confidence
interval [CI]: 0.26, 0.75). In a post-hoc analysis, the benefit for this secondary
endpoint was observed for patients with baseline UPCR < 1.5 g/g or ≥ 1.5 g/g,
although the magnitude of effect was larger in patients with UPCR ≥ 1.5 g/g (18%
vs. 36 for Tarpeyo vs. placebo, respectively; HR 0.51; 95% CI: 0.21, 1.12) vs. UPCR
< 1.5 g/g (8% vs. 14% for Tarpeyo vs. placebo, respectively; HR 0.42; 95% CI:
0.21, 0.83). There was a durable reduction in proteinuria with Tarpeyo, the maximal
effect of Tarpeyo vs. placebo was observed at 1 year (reduction in UPCR of
approximately 50% with Tarpeyo); at Year 2, from baseline, UPCR reduction was
similar to that observed at Month 9 (~ 30%).
Guidelines
Tarpeyo is recognized as new therapy for high-risk IgAN patients by the Kidney
Diseases Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for the management IgAN
and immunoglobulin A vasculitis (2024).3 According to the guidelines, budesonide
products are recommended for a 9-month treatment course for patients who are at
risk of progressive kidney function loss with IgAN.
Following biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of IgAN, the guidelines recommend assessment
of disease progression.3 The primary focus of IgAN treatment should include multiple
modalities such as renin angiotensin system blockage (maximum dose or maximum
tolerated dose), blood pressure control, cardiovascular risk minimization, and
adherence to lifestyle advice (i.e., dietary counseling, smoking cessation, weight
control, and exercise as appropriate). When proteinuria remains ≥ 0.5 g/day despite
≥ 90 days of optimized supportive care, the patient has a high risk of progressive
loss of kidney function and may be considered for a 6-month course of steroid therapy
(recently cited trials include prednisone or methylprednisolone), or preferably the
3 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Nephrology – Tarpeyo Prior Authorization Policy
opportunity to take part in a clinical trial.4 Guidelines point out that the clinical benefit
of steroids in IgAN is not established, and should be used with extreme caution or
avoided in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2, diabetes, obesity (body mass
index > 30 kg/m2), latent infections (e.g., tuberculosis, viral hepatitis), secondary
disease (e.g., cirrhosis), active peptic ulceration, uncontrolled psychiatric illness, and
severe osteoporosis. There are no data to support the efficacy or reduced toxicity of
alternate day steroid regimens or dose-reduced protocols.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Tarpeyo. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Tarpeyo as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Tarpeyo to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
