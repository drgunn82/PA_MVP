REVIEW DATE: 07/07/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Ekterly, a plasma kallikrein inhibitor, is indicated for the treatment of acute
attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE) in adult and pediatric patients ≥ 12
years of age.1
Guidelines
According to US HAE Association Medical Advisory Board Guidelines (2020), when
HAE is suspected based on clinical presentation, appropriate testing includes
measurement of the serum C4 level, C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) antigenic level,
and C1-INH functional level.2 Low C4 plus low C1-INH antigenic or functional level
is consistent with a diagnosis of HAE types I/II. The goal of acute therapy is to
minimize morbidity and prevent mortality from an ongoing HAE attack. Patients
must have ready access to effective on-demand medication to administer at the
onset of an HAE attack. All HAE attacks are eligible for treatment, irrespective of
the location of swelling or severity of the attack. First-line treatments include

Policy
plasma-derived C1-INH, Ruconest® (C1-INH [recombinant] intravenous [IV]
infusion), Kalbitor® (ecallantide subcutaneous injection), and icatibant.
In guidelines from the World Allergy Organization/European Academy of Allergy and
Clinical Immunology (2021), it is recommended that all attacks be treated with
either IV C1-INH, Kalbitor, or icatibant (evidence level A for all).3 Regarding IV C1-
INH, it is noted that Berinert® (C1 esterase inhibitor [human] IV infusion) and
Cinryze® (C1 esterase inhibitor [human] IV infusion) are both plasma-derived
products available for this use, although indications vary globally. It is essential
that patients have on-demand medication to treat all attacks; thus, the guidelines
recommend that patients have and carry medication for treatment of at least two
attacks.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Ekterly. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Ekterly,
approval requires Ekterly to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician
who specializes in the condition being treated. A patient who has previously met
initial therapy criteria for Ekterly for the requested indication under the Coverage
Review Department and is currently receiving the requested therapy is only
required to meet the continuation therapy criteria (i.e., patient who has treated
previous HAE attacks with Ekterly). If past criteria have not been met under the
Coverage Review Department and the patient has treated previous HAE attacks
with Ekterly, initial therapy criteria must be met.
Documentation: Documentation is required for use of Ekterly as noted in the
criteria as [documentation required]. Documentation may include, but is not
limited to, chart notes, prescription claims records, prescription receipts, and/or
other information.

Policy
Note: A diagnosis of HAE with normal C1-INH (also known as HAE type
III) does NOT satisfy this requirement.
a) Patient has low levels of functional C1-INH protein (< 50% of normal)
at baseline, as defined by the laboratory reference values
[documentation required]; AND
b) Patient has lower than normal serum C4 levels at baseline, as defined

ii. According to the prescriber, the patient has had a favorable clinical
response with Ekterly treatment; AND
