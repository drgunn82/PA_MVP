• Impavido® (miltefosine capsules − Profounda)
REVIEW DATE: 04/23/2025
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Impavido, an anti-leishmanial agent, is indicated in patients ≥ 12 years of age
weighing ≥ 30 kg (66 lbs) for the treatment of:1
• Visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania donovani.
• Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, and L.
panamensis.
• Mucosal leishmaniasis caused by L. braziliensis.
The treatment duration is 28 consecutive days. Limitation of use: Leishmania species
studied in clinical trials evaluating Impavido were based on epidemiologic data; there
may be geographic variation in clinical response of the same Leishmania species to
Impavido; and the efficacy of Impavido in the treatment of other Leishmania species
has not been evaluated.

A systematic review of four studies conducted in the Americas evaluated the efficacy
of Impavido in pediatric patients ≤ 12 years of age with cutaneous leishmaniasis (n
= 130).2 The regimen was similar for all studies, with a target dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day
(given as three times a day) for 28 days. The reported efficacy ranged from 63.1%
to 82.8%.
Guidelines/Recommendations
Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for treatment of
Leishmaniasis (2016) note that Impavido can be used as monotherapy.3
Amphotericin B is also a treatment option for Leishmaniasis. IDSA recommends
minimizing exposure to and preventing sand fly bites especially for
immunocompromised travelers.
The FDA has given Impavido an Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of
leishmaniasis, granulomatous amebic encephalitis (GAE), primary amebic
encephalitis (PAM), and Acanthomeoba keratitis.4 The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) recognizes Impavido as a treatment option for Ameba-related
infections cause by Naegleria fowleri, Balamuthia, and Acanthamoeba.5 Impavido is
recommended as part of a treatment regimen of often more than five medications
that include amphotericin B, an azole, rifampin, flucytosine, pentamidine,
sulfadiazine, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for GAE infections.6 PAM infections
are treated with Impavido plus antifungals and antibiotics (include amphotericin B,
rifampin, an azole, and azithromycin).7 Patients may require antiseizure and
dexamethasone to control seizures and cerebral edema. Therapeutic hypothermia is
often used and has been associated with survival and neurologic recovery.
Safety
Impavido is contraindicated in pregnancy; it may cause fetal harm based on animal
data.1 Pregnancy status should be verified prior to initiating. Females of reproductive
potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 5 months after
the last dose.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Impavido. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Impavido as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Impavido to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
