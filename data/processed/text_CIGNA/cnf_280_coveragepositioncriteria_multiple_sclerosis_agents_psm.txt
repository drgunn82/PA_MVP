INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
The following Coverage Policy applies to health benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Certain Cigna
Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients and do not make coverage
determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and coverage determinations do not apply to those
clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered
by Cigna Companies. Please note, the terms of a customer's particular benefit plan document [Group Service
Agreement, Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan
document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage Policies are based.
For example, a customer's benefit plan document may contain a specific exclusion related to a topic addressed in a
Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer's benefit plan document always supersedes the information in
the Coverage Policies. In the absence of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately
determined by the terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance
require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date of service; 2) any
applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including Coverage Policies and; 4) the
specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical
directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment where appropriate and have discretion in making individual
coverage determinations. Where coverage for care or services does not depend on specific circumstances,
reimbursement will only be provided if a requested service(s) is submitted in accordance with the relevant criteria
outlined in the applicable Coverage Policy, including covered diagnosis and/or procedure code(s). Reimbursement is
not allowed for services when billed for conditions or diagnoses that are not covered under this Coverage Policy (see
"Coding Information" below). When billing, providers must use the most appropriate codes as of the effective date
of the submission. Claims submitted for services that are not accompanied by covered code(s) under the applicable
Coverage Policy will be denied as not covered. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health
benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used as treatment
guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support medical necessity and other
coverage determinations.

Copaxone: The exception criteria were revised due to changes in

Products (generic glatiramer injection AND generic dimethyl
fumarate delayed-release capsules); documentation was added for
both of these trials. For the generic dimethyl fumarate delayed-
release capsules, documentation has to be provided that the patient
has experienced inadequate efficacy or significant intolerance,
according to the prescriber. Also, for the trial of generic glatiramer
injection, documentation has to be provided that the patient cannot
continue to use generic glatiramer injection due to a formulation
difference in the inactive ingredient(s) [e.g., preservatives] between
the brand and the bioequivalent generic product which, per the
prescriber, would result in a significant allergy or serious adverse
reaction. Exceptions were added for a patient who has been
established on a glatiramer product for ≥ 120 days that a trial of
generic dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules are not
required. Exception criteria regarding generic fingolimod and
generic teriflunomide were deleted.
Extavia: The exception criteria were revised due to changes in the
Preferred Products. For the Multiple Sclerosis Preferred Specialty
Management Program, previously, a patient was required to try one
of the following: generic glatiramer injection, generic dimethyl
fumarate delayed-release capsules, generic fingolimod capsules, or
generic teriflunomide tablets. Generic fingolimod capsules and
generic teriflunomide tablets were removed as Preferred Products.
Now, a patient is required to try both Preferred Products (generic
glatiramer injection AND generic dimethyl fumarate delayed-release
capsules); documentation was added for both of these trials. Also,
