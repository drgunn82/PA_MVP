CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Tezspire, a thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) blocker, is indicated as add-on
maintenance treatment of severe asthma in patients ≥ 12 years of age.1
Clinical Efficacy
Tezspire has been studied in patients ≥ 12 years of age with severe asthma.2 The
patients enrolled in the Phase III pivotal Tezspire trial had experienced two or more
asthma exacerbations in the previous year, despite treatment with a medium- or
high-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and one additional controller medication (e.g.,
long-acting beta -agonist [LABA], leukotriene antagonist).2,3 In one study, 6 months
2
of these previous therapies were required for enrollment, while in another, 12 months
of ICS therapy with at least 3 months of additional controller therapy was required.
In these trials, asthma exacerbation data was evaluated following 52 weeks of
treatment. However, improvements in lung function parameters and symptom
scores were reported as early as the first post-baseline assessment (i.e., 2 weeks of
therapy).
Guidelines
Page 1 of 7 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Immunologicals – Tezspire Prior Authorization Policy
The Global Initiative for Asthma Global Strategy for Asthma Management and
Prevention (2024) proposes a stepwise approach to asthma treatment.4 Tezspire is
listed as an option for add-on therapy in patients ≥ 12 years of age with uncontrolled
severe asthma. Severe asthma is defined as asthma that is uncontrolled despite
adherence to optimized high-dose ICS/LABA therapy or that worsens when high-dose
treatment is decreased. Higher blood eosinophil levels and higher fractional exhaled
nitric oxide may predict a good asthma response to Tezspire.
According to the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society guidelines
(2014; updated in 2020), severe asthma is defined as asthma which requires
treatment with a high-dose ICS in addition to a second controller medication (and/or
systemic corticosteroids) to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled, or asthma which
remains uncontrolled despite this therapy.5,6 Uncontrolled asthma is defined as
asthma that worsens upon tapering of high-dose ICS or systemic corticosteroids or
asthma that meets one of the following four criteria:
1) Poor symptom control: Asthma Control Questionnaire consistently ≥ 1.5 or
Asthma Control Test < 20;
2) Frequent severe exacerbations: two or more bursts of systemic corticosteroids in
the previous year;
3) Serious exacerbations: at least one hospitalization, intensive care unit stay, or
mechanical ventilation in the previous year;
4) Airflow limitation: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) < 80% predicted
1
after appropriate bronchodilator withholding.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Tezspire. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Tezspire as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, initial approval
requires Tezspire to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Tezspire® (tezepelumab-ekko subcutaneous injection (
AstraZeneca/Amgen)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Asthma. Approve Tezspire for the duration noted if the patient meets ONE of the
following (A or B):
4 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Immunologicals – Tezspire Prior Authorization Policy
A) Initial Therapy. Approve for 6 months if the patient meets ALL of the following
(i, ii, iii, and iv):
i. Patient is ≥ 12 years of age; AND
ii. Patient has received at least 3 consecutive months of combination therapy
with BOTH of the following (a and b):

inhaled corticosteroid-containing combination inhaler; AND
iii. Patient has responded to therapy as determined by the prescriber.
Note: Examples of a response to Tezspire therapy are decreased asthma
exacerbations; decreased asthma symptoms; decreased hospitalizations,
emergency department, urgent care, or medical clinic visits due to asthma;
improved lung function parameters; and/or a decreased requirement for
oral corticosteroid therapy.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Tezspire® (tezepelumab-ekko subcutaneous injection (
AstraZeneca/Amgen)
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Atopic Dermatitis. Tezspire is not indicated for the treatment of atopic
dermatitis.1 One Phase IIa study, ALLEVIAD (published) [n = 113] evaluated the
efficacy of Tezspire in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS) vs. placebo
in adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.7 At Week 12, a larger
proportion of patients in the Tezspire + TCS group achieved a 50% reduction in
the Eczema Area and Severity Index (primary efficacy endpoint) compared with
placebo + TCS. However, this treatment difference was not statistically
significant. Another Phase II, dose-ranging study in patients with atopic
dermatitis was terminated prior to completion.8
2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Tezspire is not indicated
for the treatment of COPD.1 One Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial, COURSE, evaluated the efficacy of Tezspire in patients with
moderate- to very severe-COPD who continued to experience exacerbations
despite triple inhaled maintenance therapy (i.e., ICS/LABA/long-acting muscarinic
antagonist).8 In this patient population, Tezspire did not result in a significant
reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations
compared with placebo.9
3. Chronic Rhinosinusitis with Nasal Polyposis (CRSwNP). Tezspire is not
indicated for the treatment of CRSwNP.1 One Phase III, randomized, double-blind,
4 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Immunologicals – Tezspire Prior Authorization Policy
placebo-controlled trial, WAYPOINT, evaluated the efficacy of Tezspire in adults
with severe CRSwNP.10 Following 52 weeks of therapy, Tezspire significantly
improved the total Nasal Polyp Score and the mean Nasal Congestion Score
compared with placebo. A post-hoc analysis of one of the Tezspire pivotal asthma
studies also showed an improvement in sino-nasal symptoms with Tezspire in
patients with concomitant asthma and CRSwNP.11 Additional data are needed.
4. Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria. Tezspire is not indicated for the treatment of
chronic spontaneous urticaria.1 One Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trial, INCEPTION, evaluated the efficacy of Tezspire in patients with
chronic spontaneous urticaria.8,12 Results are available from a subgroup of anti-
immunoglobulin E-naïve patients. In this subgroup, there was numeric
improvement in the Urticaria Activity Score over 7 days (UAS7) at Week 16
compared with placebo; these improvements were not significant compared with
placebo.
5. Concurrent use of Tezspire with another Monoclonal Antibody Therapy.
The efficacy and safety of Tezspire used in combination with other monoclonal
antibody therapies have not been established.
Note: Monoclonal antibody therapies are Adbry® (tralokinumab-ldrm
subcutaneous [SC] injection), Cinqair® (reslizumab intravenous infusion),
Dupixent® (dupilumab SC injection), Ebglyss™ (lebrikizumab-lbkz SC injection),
Fasenra® (benralizumab SC injection), Nemluvio® (nemolizumab-ilto SC
injection), Nucala® (mepolizumab SC injection), or Xolair® (omalizumab SC
injection).
