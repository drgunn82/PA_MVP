CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Filspari, an endothelin and angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is indicated to slow
kidney function decline in adults with primary immunoglobulin A nephropathy
(IgAN) who are at risk of rapid disease progression.1
Filspari is contraindicated for use with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)
inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), or aliskiren.1 RAAS inhibitors,
ERAs, and/or aliskiren must be discontinued prior to initiation of Filspari.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Filspari is being assessed in an ongoing Phase III trial in adults with
biopsy-proven IgAN, proteinuria ≥ 1.0 g/day at screening, and estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (PROTECT, n = 404).2 Additionally
patients were receiving the maximum tolerated dose (at least one-half of the
maximum labeled dose) of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or
angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for ≥ 12 weeks prior to study entry and had blood
pressure of ≤ 150/100 mmHg (managed according to standard of care). Patients
with use of immunosuppressive medications (including corticosteroids for > 2 weeks
within 3 months of screening), chronic kidney disease (CKD) in addition to IgAN, or
Page 1 of 5 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Nephrology – Filspari Prior Authorization Policy
IgAN secondary to other conditions were excluded. Per study protocol, patients
discontinued their ACEi or ARB 1 day prior to the start of Filspari.2
The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in urine protein-to-
creatinine ratio (based on 24-hour urine sample) at Week 36.2 The primary analysis
was based on an interim data cutoff of August 1, 2021. At Week 36, the primary
endpoint was significantly greater with Filspari vs. irbesartan in the interim analysis
set (comprised of the first 281 patients randomized in the study, including 2 patients
who were not treated); the geometric least squares mean percent change in UPCR
from baseline was -45% vs. -15%, respectively. This resulted in a statistically
significant relative reduction from baseline in UPCR for the Filspari vs. irbesartan
group (geometric mean ratio 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6, 0.8; P <
0.0001), corresponding to a 35% relative reduction with Filspari. Supportive
secondary endpoints for changes in UPCR from baseline to Week 94 and urine
albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline to Weeks 36 and 94, were
significantly greater with Filspari. A confirmed 40% reduction in eGFR, end-stage
kidney disease, or death was reported in a smaller proportion of patients treated with
Filspari (3.5%) vs. irbesartan (6.4%) [P = not estimable].
Several exploratory endpoints also favored Filspari over irbesartan. At the interim
analysis (Week 36), the proportion of patients in the Filspari group who achieved
partial proteinuria remission (< 1 g/day) was significantly higher with Filspari vs.
irbesartan (55% vs. 24%, respectively) and numerically more patients in the Filspari
vs. irbesartan group (11% vs. 4%, respectively) achieved complete proteinuria
remission (< 0.3 g/day) at Week 36.
Following the 36 week randomized, treatment period, patients were followed until
the patient reached Week 110.5 The significant reduction in proteinuria at Week 36
was maintained through Week 110. The UPCR at Week 110 was 40% lower in the
Filspari group compared to the irbesartan group (-42·8% with Filspari versus -4·4%
with irbesartan). Filspari also reduced the rate of decline in kidney function from
baseline to Week 110 when compared with irbesartan (-3.0 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year
for Filspari vs. 4.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year for irbesartan) with a corresponding
treatment effect of 1.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (P = 0.0168).
Guidelines
Kidney Diseases: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines
for the management of IgAN and immunoglobulin A vasculitis (2024) recommend
Filspari for patients who are at risk of progressive kidney function loss with IgAN.3
Therapeutic strategies that minimize or avoid systemic glucocorticoid exposure are
considered areas of priority for future research to improve the treatment and
outcomes of patients with IgAN.
Following biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of IgAN, the guidelines recommend assessment
of disease progression.3 The primary focus of IgAN treatment should include multiple
modalities such as RAAS blockage (maximum dose or maximum tolerated dose),
blood pressure control, cardiovascular risk minimization, and adherence to lifestyle
advice (i.e., dietary counseling, smoking cessation, weight control, and exercise as
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Nephrology – Filspari Prior Authorization Policy
appropriate). RAAS blockade (with either an ACEi or ARB) is recommended regardless
of hypertension if a patient has proteinuria > 0.5 g/day (500 mg/day). There are no
data to suggest that dual blockade with an ACEi and ARB is superior to single
blockade. In patients who remain at high risk of progressive CKD despite maximal
supportive care, a 6-month course of glucocorticoid therapy should be considered.
Safety
Filspari has a Black Box Warning and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)
program around hepatotoxicity and embryo-fetal toxicity.1,4 The three objectives of
the REMS are to monitor for elevations in liver enzymes in patients exposed to
Filspari, ensure that patients who can become pregnant are not pregnant before
initiating Filspari, and to minimize exposure in patients who may become pregnant
while taking Filspari.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Filspari. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Filspari as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval requires
Filspari to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the
condition being treated.
