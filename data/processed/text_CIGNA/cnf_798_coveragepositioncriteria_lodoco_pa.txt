INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT
PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN
CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Lodoco, an alkaloid, is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI),
stroke, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular (CV) death in adults with
established atherosclerotic disease or with multiple risk factors for CV disease.1 The
safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of Lodoco was evaluated in one, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-
driven, investigator-initiated, pivotal study called LoDoCo2 involving 5,522 adults
with chronic stable coronary disease who received Lodoco 0.5 mg once daily or
matching placebo.1,2 The mean patient age was 66 years; only 15% of patients were
female. Patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥ 50 mL/min. An acute
coronary syndrome event had occurred previously in 84% of patients. Most patients
were also receiving standard of care therapy for secondary prevention of CV events.
Examples of medications utilized for chronic coronary disease included antiplatelet
agents or an anticoagulant (99.7%), a lipid-lowering agent (96.6% [mostly statins]),
a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (71.7%), and beta-blockers (62.1%). The
median time on study medication was 28.6 months. A primary endpoint event (a
composite of CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, or ischemia-driven coronary
revascularization) occurred in 6.8% of patients randomized to Lodoco vs. 9.6% of
patients receiving placebo (hazard ratio 0.69; P < 0.001).

Guidelines
Guidelines for the management of patients with chronic coronary disease from the
American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (2023) state that
in patients with chronic coronary disease, the addition of colchicine for secondary
prevention may be considered to reduce recurrent atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease events (Class of Recommendation: 2b [weak] {benefit ≥ risk}; Level of
Evidence: randomized).3
