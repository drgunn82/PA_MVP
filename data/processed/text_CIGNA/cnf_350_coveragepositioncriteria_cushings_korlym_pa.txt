INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Mifepristone, a cortisol receptor blocker, is indicated to control hyperglycemia
secondary to hypercortisolism in adults with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome
who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose intolerance and have failed surgery or
are not candidates for surgery.1
Mifepristone should not be used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus
unrelated to endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.1
Disease Overview
Cushing's syndrome refers to the general state of excessive levels of cortisol
(hypercortisolism) in the blood.2,3 Hypercortisolism can occur for reasons that are
either endogenous or exogenous in nature (e.g., Cushing’s disease, cortisol-
containing medications, adrenal gland tumor, certain cancers). Cushing’s disease
(hypercortisolism caused by pituitary adenomas) is the most common type of
Page 1 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Cushing’s (Mifepristone Prior Authorization Policy)
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent Cushing’s syndrome. Treatment for
Cushing’s syndrome requires a multi-modal approach. The goals of treatment are
normalization of cortisol excess, long-term disease control, avoidance of recurrence,
and reversal of clinical features.4
Guidelines
The Endocrine Society published clinical practice guidelines (2015) for the treatment
of Cushing’s syndrome.5 First-line treatment involves resection of the tumor, unless
surgery is not possible or is unlikely to meaningfully reduce excess glucocorticoid
levels. In patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome who underwent non-
curative surgery or for whom surgery was not possible, the guidelines advocate
several second-line therapies (e.g., repeat transsphenoidal surgery, radiotherapy,
medical therapy, bilateral adrenalectomy). For Cushing’s disease, the guidelines
recommend all medical therapies as second-line options after transsphenoidal
surgery: steroidogenesis inhibitors (ketoconazole tablets, Metopirone® [metyrapone
capsules], Lysodren® [mitotane tablets], etomidate injection) in patients either with
or without radiotherapy/radiosurgery; pituitary-directed medical treatments
(cabergoline tablets, Signifor® [pasireotide subcutaneous injection]) in patients who
are not surgical candidates or who have persistent disease; and mifepristone tablets
(Korlym®, generic) in patients with diabetes or glucose intolerance who are not
surgical candidates or who have persistent disease after transsphenoidal surgery.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of mifepristone.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval
is authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with mifepristone as
well as the monitoring required for adverse events and long-term efficacy, approval
requires mifepristone to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician who
specializes in the condition being treated.
• Korlym® (mifepristone 300 mg tablets - Corcept, generic)
is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Endogenous Cushing’s Syndrome. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ALL
of the following (A, B, C, D, and E):
A) Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
B) Mifepristone is being used to control hyperglycemia secondary to
hypercortisolism in patients who have type 2 diabetes mellitus or glucose
intolerance; AND
C) Patient meets ONE of the following (i, ii, or iii):
Page 2 of 4 - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy: Cushing’s (Mifepristone Prior Authorization Policy)
i. According to the prescriber, the patient is not a candidate for surgery or
surgery has not been curative; OR
ii. Patient is awaiting surgery for endogenous Cushing’s syndrome; OR
iii. Patient is awaiting therapeutic response after radiotherapy for endogenous
Cushing’s syndrome; AND
D) Patient meets ONE of the following (i or ii):
i. Patient has tried one of ketoconazole tablets, Metopirone (metyrapone
capsules), Lysodren (mitotane tablets), Signifor (pasireotide subcutaneous
injection), or Signifor LAR (pasireotide intramuscular injection) for the
treatment of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome; OR
ii. Patient is currently receiving mifepristone; AND
E) The medication is prescribed by or in consultation with an endocrinologist or a
physician who specializes in the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Korlym® (mifepristone 300 mg tablets (Corcept, generic)
is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s); including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available.):
1. Type 2 Diabetes Not Associated with Endogenous Cushing’s Syndrome.
Mifepristone should not be used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes unrelated to
endogenous Cushing’s syndrome.1
2. Psychotic Features of Psychotic Depression. Mifepristone has been used to
treat the psychotic features of psychotic depression. Individual trials have
demonstrated variable efficacy results.6,7 In some of the studies comparing
mifepristone with placebo, various statistically significant improvements in
psychiatric symptoms have been noted with mifepristone relative to placebo;
however, the methodology and statistical analyses of some studies have been
questioned. Data are inconclusive.
