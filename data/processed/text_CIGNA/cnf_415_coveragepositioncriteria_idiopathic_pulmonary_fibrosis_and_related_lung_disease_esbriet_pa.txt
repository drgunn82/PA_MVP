INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. EACH COVERAGE REQUEST SHOULD BE REVIEWED ON ITS OWN MERITS. MEDICAL
DIRECTORS ARE EXPECTED TO EXERCISE CLINICAL JUDGMENT WHERE APPROPRIATE AND HAVE DISCRETION IN MAKING INDIVIDUAL
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS. WHERE COVERAGE FOR CARE OR SERVICES DOES NOT DEPEND ON SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES,
REIMBURSEMENT WILL ONLY BE PROVIDED IF A REQUESTED SERVICE(S) IS SUBMITTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT CRITERIA
OUTLINED IN THE APPLICABLE COVERAGE POLICY, INCLUDING COVERED DIAGNOSIS AND/OR PROCEDURE CODE(S). REIMBURSEMENT IS
NOT ALLOWED FOR SERVICES WHEN BILLED FOR CONDITIONS OR DIAGNOSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED UNDER THIS COVERAGE POLICY
(SEE "CODING INFORMATION" BELOW). WHEN BILLING, PROVIDERS MUST USE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CODES AS OF THE EFFECTIVE
DATE OF THE SUBMISSION. CLAIMS SUBMITTED FOR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY COVERED CODE(S) UNDER THE APPLICABLE
COVERAGE POLICY WILL BE DENIED AS NOT COVERED. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH
BENEFIT PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT
GUIDELINES. IN CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER
COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Pirfenidone, a pyridone, is indicated for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF).1
The safety and effectiveness of pirfenidone in pediatric patients have not been
established.
Disease Overview
IPF is a form of chronic interstitial lung pneumonia associated with histologic pattern
of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP).2 The condition is specific for patients that have
clinical features and the histologic pattern of UIP or a classical high-resolution
computed tomography scan for IPF. In this lung condition there is cellular
proliferation, interstitial inflammation, fibrosis, or the combination of these findings,

– Pirfenidone Prior Authorization Policy
within the alveolar wall that is not due to infection or cancer.3 IPF is rather rare and
the prevalence in the US ranges from 10 to 60 cases per 100,000. However, in one
study, the prevalence was 494 cases per 100,000 in 2011 in adults > 65 years of
age, which is higher than previous information. The disease mainly impacts older
adults.2 Symptoms include a progressive dry cough and exertional dyspnea. Patients
experience a high disease burden with hospital admissions. The clinical course varies
among patients but the mean survival after symptom onset is usually 3 to 5 years.
The cause is unknown but environmental and occupational hazards may play a role,
as well as a history of smoking. Medical therapy is only modestly effective and mainly
shows the rate of disease progression. Agents FDA-approved for IPF are Ofev®
(nintedanib capsules) and pirfenidone. Lung transplantation is a therapeutic option.
Clinical Efficacy
The efficacy of pirfenidone was assessed in patients with IPF in three Phase III,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational trials (n =
1,247).1,4,5 Patients were required to have a percent predicted forced vital capacity
(%FVC) ≥ 50% at baseline. Pirfenidone 2,403 mg/day led to a statistically significant
change in the %FVC at 52 weeks and 72 weeks, respectively. Also, a reduction in
the mean decline in forced vital capacity (in mL) was observed in both studies for
patients receiving pirfenidone 2,403 mg/day compared with placebo.1-3 Some
information suggests that patients who have %FVC < 50% may also have some
benefits from therapy.6-9
Guidelines
In 2015, the clinical practice guideline from the American Thoracic Society (ATS),
European Respiratory Society (ERS), the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS), and
Latin American Thoracic Association (ALAT) on the treatment of IPF was updated.10
Regarding pirfenidone, the guideline suggests use of this medication (conditional
recommendation, moderate confidence in estimates of effect). The guideline notes
that the data with pirfenidone cannot be generalized to patients with IPF who have
more severe impairment of pulmonary function tests or for patients with other
significant comorbidities.10 Updated recommendations by this group in 2022 support
use of pirfenidone in patients with IPF.11
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of pirfenidone.
All approvals are provided for the duration noted below. Because of the specialized
skills required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with pirfenidone,
approval requires pirfenidone to be prescribed by or in consultation with a physician
who specializes in the condition being treated.

is(are) covered as medically necessary when the following criteria is(are)
met for FDA-approved indication(s) or other uses with supportive evidence
(if applicable):
FDA-Approved Indication
1. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. Approve for 1 year if the patient meets ONE
of the following (A or B):
A) Initial Therapy. Approve if the patient meets ALL of the following (i, ii, iii, and
iv):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Forced vital capacity is ≥ 40% of the predicted value; AND
iii. Diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is confirmed by ONE of the
following (a or b):
a) Findings on high-resolution computed tomography indicate usual
interstitial pneumonia; OR
b) A surgical lung biopsy demonstrates usual interstitial pneumonia; AND
iv. Medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a pulmonologist; OR
B) Patient is Currently Receiving Pirfenidone. Approve if the patient meets ALL of
the following (i, ii, and iii):
i. Patient is ≥ 18 years of age; AND
ii. Patient has experienced a beneficial response to therapy over the last year
while receiving pirfenidone; AND
Note: For a patient who has received less than 1 year of therapy, response
is from baseline prior to initiating pirfenidone. Examples of a beneficial
response include a reduction in the anticipated decline in forced vital
capacity, six-minute walk distance, and/or a reduction in the number or
severity of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis exacerbations.
iii. Medication is prescribed by or in consultation with a pulmonologist.
CONDITIONS NOT COVERED

is(are) considered not medically necessary for ANY other use(s) including
the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will be updated as
new published data are available):
1. Pirfenidone is Being Used Concomitantly with Ofev (nintedanib
capsules). Ofev is another medication indicated for the treatment of IPF. The
effectiveness and safety of concomitant use of pirfenidone with Ofev have not
been established. The 2015 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guideline
regarding the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (an update of the 2011
clinical practice guideline) does not recommend taking Ofev and pirfenidone in

combination.10 A small exploratory study was done in which patients with IPF
receiving Ofev added on pirfenidone.12 Further research is needed to determine
the utility of this combination regimen.
