INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
THE FOLLOWING COVERAGE POLICY APPLIES TO HEALTH BENEFIT PLANS ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. CERTAIN CIGNA
COMPANIES AND/OR LINES OF BUSINESS ONLY PROVIDE UTILIZATION REVIEW SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND DO NOT MAKE COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS. REFERENCES TO STANDARD BENEFIT PLAN LANGUAGE AND COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO THOSE
CLIENTS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN INTERPRETING CERTAIN STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS
ADMINISTERED BY CIGNA COMPANIES. PLEASE NOTE, THE TERMS OF A CUSTOMER'S PARTICULAR BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT [GROUP
SERVICE AGREEMENT, EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE, CERTIFICATE OF COVERAGE, SUMMARY PLAN DESCRIPTION (SPD) OR SIMILAR PLAN
DOCUMENT] MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE STANDARD BENEFIT PLANS UPON WHICH THESE COVERAGE POLICIES ARE BASED. FOR
EXAMPLE, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT MAY CONTAIN A SPECIFIC EXCLUSION RELATED TO A TOPIC ADDRESSED IN A COVERAGE
POLICY. IN THE EVENT OF A CONFLICT, A CUSTOMER'S BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT ALWAYS SUPERSEDES THE INFORMATION IN THE
COVERAGE POLICIES. IN THE ABSENCE OF A CONTROLLING FEDERAL OR STATE COVERAGE MANDATE, BENEFITS ARE ULTIMATELY
DETERMINED BY THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT. COVERAGE DETERMINATIONS IN EACH SPECIFIC INSTANCE
REQUIRE CONSIDERATION OF 1) THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE BENEFIT PLAN DOCUMENT IN EFFECT ON THE DATE OF SERVICE; 2) ANY
APPLICABLE LAWS/REGULATIONS; 3) ANY RELEVANT COLLATERAL SOURCE MATERIALS INCLUDING COVERAGE POLICIES AND; 4) THE
SPECIFIC FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR SITUATION. COVERAGE POLICIES RELATE EXCLUSIVELY TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF HEALTH BENEFIT
PLANS. COVERAGE POLICIES ARE NOT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TREATMENT AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED AS TREATMENT GUIDELINES. IN
CERTAIN MARKETS, DELEGATED VENDOR GUIDELINES MAY BE USED TO SUPPORT MEDICAL NECESSITY AND OTHER COVERAGE
DETERMINATIONS.
CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Cetrotide (brand only), Ganirelix (brand and generic), and Fyremadel (generic only)
are indicated for the inhibition of premature luteinizing hormone (LH) surges
in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation.1-3
Cetrotide, Ganirelix, and Fyremadel are synthetic decapeptides that are analogs of
native gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) with GnRH antagonist activity.1-3
GnRH induces the production and release of LH and follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH) from the anterior pituitary. Both agents compete with natural GnRH for
binding to membrane receptors on pituitary cells and control the release of LH and
FSH in a reversible manner.
POLICY STATEMENT

Antagonists Preferred Specialty Management Policy
Utilization of these products for infertility is not managed by a Prior Authorization
Policy, but rather based on whether a patient’s benefit includes infertility coverage.
If the patient’s benefit includes infertility coverage, this Preferred Specialty
Management program has been developed to encourage the use of a Preferred
Product. The program directs the patient to try one Preferred Product prior to the
approval of a Non-Preferred Product. Requests for a Non-Preferred Product will be
reviewed using the exception criteria (below). All approvals are provided for the
duration noted below.
If the patient’s benefit does not include infertility coverage, benefit exclusion
overrides may be in place for indications other than infertility. This Preferred
Specialty Management program requires the patient to meet the standard Infertility
– Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Antagonists Benefit Exclusion Overrides Policy
criteria and requires the patient to try a Preferred Product, when clinically
appropriate, prior to the approval of a Non-Preferred Product. Patient meeting the
standard Infertility – Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Antagonists Benefit
Exclusion Overrides Policy criteria who have not tried a Preferred Product will
receive authorization for a Preferred Product, if clinically appropriate.
If the patient’s benefit does not include infertility coverage and benefit exclusion
overrides are not utilized, coverage is not reviewable.
