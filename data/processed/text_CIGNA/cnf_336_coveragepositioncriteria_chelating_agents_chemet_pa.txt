CIGNA NATIONAL FORMULARY COVERAGE:
OVERVIEW
Chemet, a heavy metal chelator, is indicated for the treatment of lead poisoning in
pediatric patients with blood lead levels > 45 mcg/dL.1 Chemet is not indicated for
prophylaxis of lead poisoning in a lead-containing environment; the use of Chemet
should be accompanied by identification and removal of the source of the lead
exposure. Safety and efficacy of Chemet in children < 12 months of age have not
been established. The course of therapy is 19 days. If indicated, a repeat course may
be given with a minimum of 2 weeks between courses, unless blood lead levels
indicate the need for more prompt treatment. The chemical name for Chemet is meso
2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).
Disease Overview
Lead, mercury, arsenic, and iron account for most cases of diagnosed heavy metal
poisoning in the US.2 Most cases of lead poisoning are in children who swallow lead-
based paint in homes or toys; other causes include water carried through pipes made
of lead or containing lead solder. Children are especially susceptible to the toxic
effects of lead, which may affect the developing brain and nervous system, potentially
causing lower IQs, learning difficulties, hearing loss, and behavior difficulties. In
adults, lead poisoning can cause high blood pressure and kidney damage.

Treatment Recommendations
Treatment of heavy metal poisoning includes removing the patient from the source
of the metal and treating the patient’s symptoms.2 Diagnosis includes the patient’s
history, symptoms, and blood or urine tests.2,4,5 Treatment of acute metal poisoning
involves emergency care and generally requires the use of chelating agents, such as
DMSA.6
Other Uses with Supportive Evidence
Arsenic is a naturally-occurring substance; in some areas of the world, low-level
arsenic exposure occurs because of the presence of arsenic in ground water.2
Accidental poisoning accounts for the majority of acute arsenic toxicity.3 The Agency
for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) states that patients with severe
arsenic poisoning must be hospitalized.7 Chelation therapy can curtail the distribution
of arsenic in the body and reduce the body burden. Oral chelators, such as Chemet,
have been used with success. There are case reports to support the use of DMSA in
acute arsenic poisoning.3,8 The patients’ clinical status improved with DMSA therapy
and urine arsenic levels decreased with therapy. Note: The chemical name, DMSA,
may be used to describe the case reports in this document because it is unclear if the
FDA-approved Chemet product was used.
Mercury poisoning can result from vapor inhalation, mercury ingestion, mercury
injection, and absorption of mercury through the skin.5 Symptoms of mercury
poisoning depends on the type of mercury exposure and severity of exposure:
organic mercury (antiseptics, bactericidals, fungicides, insecticides), inorganic
mercury (chemical laboratory work, disinfectants, explosives, fur hat processing),
and elemental mercury (thermometers, batteries, dental amalgams, fluorescent
lamps). The ATSDR notes that patients with serious mercury exposure must be
hospitalized.9 Chelation should be considered for any symptomatic patient with a
clear history of acute elemental mercury exposure. The decision to chelate is less
clear in asymptomatic patients with elevated urine mercury levels.10 Oral chelators,
such as Chemet, have been used successfully for the treatment of acute mercury
intoxication/poisoning.9 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that
urine mercury concentration should not exceed 50 mcg/g creatinine.11
Several case reports have demonstrated the effectiveness of DMSA therapy for
treatment of acute mercury poisoning.12-15 All of the patients exhibited symptoms
consistent with mercury poisoning and were treated in a hospital setting. DMSA
therapy resulted in reduction of mercury levels and improved symptomatology.
POLICY STATEMENT
Prior Authorization is recommended for prescription benefit coverage of Chemet. All
approvals are provided for the duration noted below. In cases where the approval is
authorized in months, 1 month is equal to 30 days. Because of the specialized skills
required for evaluation and diagnosis of patients treated with Chemet as well as the
monitoring required for adverse events, approval requires Chemet to be prescribed
by or in consultation with a physician who specializes in the condition being treated.

CONDITIONS NOT COVERED
• Chemet® (succimer capsules (Lannett/Recordati Rare Diseases)
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Chelating Agents – Chemet Prior Authorization Policy
is(are) considered experimental, investigational or unproven for ANY other
use(s) including the following (this list may not be all inclusive; criteria will
be updated as new published data are available):
1. Concomitant Use with Other Chelators (e.g., calcium disodium versenate
injection [CaNa EDTA], dimercaprol injection [British anti-Lewisite
2
{BAL}]).
In patients with acute lead poisoning, data on the concomitant use of Chemet with
CaNa EDTA with or without BAL are not available and such use is not
2
recommended.1 Patients who have received CaNa EDTA with or without BAL may
2
use Chemet for subsequent treatment after an interval of four weeks.
2. Chelation of Heavy Metals to Treat Chronic Medical and/or Psychiatric
Conditions. Chelation of heavy metals has been advertised as a viable treatment
for numerous conditions: treatment of intermittent claudication; treatment or
management of symptoms of autism; prevention or cure of neurodegenerative
conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease; use in Parkinson’s disease; treatment of
macular degeneration.2 There is no evidence to show that chelators work in these
conditions. Furthermore, unapproved uses of chelation therapy have resulted in
harm and even death. Chelation of heavy metals is also one of several popular
interventions in children with autism spectrum disorders. The FDA notes chelation
therapies for the treatment of autism to be associated with significant health risks
and does not approve such use.16
3. Chronic Arsenic Exposure. Use of chelation therapy following chronic exposure
to inorganic arsenic may accelerate metal excretion, but potential therapeutic
efficacy in terms of decreased morbidity and mortality is largely unestablished.17
In a prospective, randomized-controlled trial, 21 patients with chronic arsenicosis
due to drinking arsenic-contaminated subsoil water were randomized to receive
DMSA (1,400 mg/day or 100 mg/m2 in four divided doses for 1 week and then
1,050 mg/day or 750 mg/m2 in three divided doses for 2 weeks; repeat the
regimen after 3 weeks) or placebo.18 The patients had history of drinking arsenic-
contaminated water (50 mcg/L or ≥ 0.05 mg/L) for at least 2 years and exhibited
clinical signs/symptoms of chronic arsenicosis. Similar improvement in the clinical
score was observed in the DMSA and placebo groups. Furthermore, urinary
arsenic excretion before treatment and at 48 hours and 72 hours post-treatment
were similar between the two groups. The investigators concluded that DMSA did
not result in clinical or biochemical benefit in patients with chronic arsenicosis.
In another case report involving a 39 year old woman with arsenic poisoning
(urine arsenic level was 2,000 mcg/L; normal level is < 10 mcg/L), DMSA 600 mg
three times a day for 45 days did not significantly affect the clearance of arsenic
or clinical outcome.19 During the 45-day course, the patient stopped therapy for
a total of 13 days (unknown reason).
4. Chronic Mercury Exposure. The American Academy of Pediatrics notes there is
no scientific evidence behind the use of chelation therapy to improve nervous
5 Pages - Cigna National Formulary Coverage - Policy:Chelating Agents – Chemet Prior Authorization Policy
system symptoms of chronic mercury toxicity.16 Use of chelation therapy
following chronic exposure to inorganic mercury may accelerate metal excretion,
but potential therapeutic efficacy in terms of decreased morbidity and mortality is
largely unestablished.17
In a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in
Sweden, 20 patients were randomized to receive DMSA 20 mg/kg/day in three
divided doses or placebo for 14 days.20 These patients experienced symptoms
that were allegedly associated with amalgam fillings for at least 6 months. DMSA
therapy resulted in increased urinary excretion of mercury and blood mercury
levels were decreased. However, there were no statistically significant changes in
any of the symptoms. The investigators concluded that although urinary excretion
of mercury was increased during DMSA treatment, chelating therapy did not
alleviate symptoms allegedly attributable to mercury from amalgam fillings.
Cao and colleagues reported the effects of Chemet in reducing blood mercury
levels in children 12 to 33 months of age.21 The original study was to evaluate
the use of Chemet for lead poisoning; the investigators used the blood samples
for the lead study and measured the mercury levels. Blood mercury
concentrations were measured one week before randomization and treatment, at
one week after treatment initiation, and after three courses of treatment. Mercury
was not detected/quantified in any of the blood samples. At one week of
treatment, organic mercury concentration decreased 8% in the Chemet group,
but remained the same in the placebo group (P = 0.04). However, the
investigators suggested that the difference was not due to a reduction in the
Chemet group but rather, Chemet therapy prevented a rise in the blood mercury
concentration as seen in the placebo group. Chemet therapy did not reverse the
accumulation of organic mercury over multiple courses over 5 months.
