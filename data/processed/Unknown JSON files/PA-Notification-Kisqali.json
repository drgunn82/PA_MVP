    "UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy\nClinical Pharmacy Programs\nProgram Number 2025 P 1215-11\nProgram Prior Authorization/Notification\nMedication Kisqali® (ribociclib)\nP&T Approval Date 5/2017, 5/2018, 9/2018, 9/2019, 4/2020, 4/2021, 2/2022, 2/2023,\n2/2024, 11/2024, 6/2025\nEffective Date 8/1/2025\n1. Background:\nKisqali (ribociclib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adult patients with hormone\nreceptor (HR)- positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- negative advanced or\nmetastatic cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor as initial endocrine-based therapy or\nfulvestrant as initial endocrine-based therapy or following disease progression on endocrine\ntherapy. Kisqali is also indicated for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the\nadjuvant treatment of adults with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor\nreceptor 2 (HER2)-negative stage II and III early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence.\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends the use of Kisqali similarly\nfor men and premenopausal women receiving ovarian ablation/suppression with recurrent\nunresectable (local or regional) or metastatic HR-positive HER2-negative breast cancer disease, in\ncombination with an aromatase inhibitor or Faslodex®(fulvestrant). The use of an aromatase\ninhibitor in men with breast cancer is ineffective without concomitant suppression of testicular\nsteroidogenesis. The NCCN also recommends Kisqali for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive\nrecurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma in combination with letrozole.\nCoverage Information:\nMembers will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage.
