Background:\nRevlimid® (lenalidomide) is a thalidomide analogue indicated for the treatment of adult patients\nwith the following: multiple myeloma (MM), in combination with dexamethasone; MM, as\nmaintenance following autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT);\ntransfusion-dependent anemia due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes\n(MDS) associated with a deletion 5q abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic\nabnormalities; mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) whose disease has relapsed or progressed after two\nprior therapies, one of which included bortezomib; previously treated follicular lymphoma (FL),\nin combination with a rituximab product; and previously treated marginal zone lymphoma\n(MZL), in combination with a rituximab product.1\nThe National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) also recommends use of Revlimid for\ntreatment of the following B-Cell lymphomas: histologic transformation of indolent lymphomas\nto diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, nodal marginal zone lymphoma, classic\nfollicular lymphoma, extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of nongastric sites (noncutaneous),\nextranodal marginal zone lymphoma (EMZL) of the stomach, high-grade B-cell lymphoma,\nsplenic marginal zone lymphoma, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders, diffuse large B-\ncell lymphoma, and HIV-related B-cell lymphomas.
