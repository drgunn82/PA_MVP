Background:\nJoenja (leniolisib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment activated phosphoinositide\n3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and\nolder.1\nAPDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency caused by variations in the genes encoding subunits of\nthe PI3Kẟ enzyme complex and PI3Kẟ hyperactivity. PI3Kẟ hyperactivity results in altered\ndevelopment of B and T-cell which can lead to severe lymphoproliferation, recurrent infections,\nautoimmune disorders, and malignancies. APDS can be characterized by a variety of symptoms,\nincluding recurrent respiratory tract infections (e.g., pneumonia, otitis media, rhinosinusitis),\nrecurrent herpesvirus infections (e.g., Epstein Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus),\nlymphoproliferation (e.g., lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly), autoimmune cytopenia and\nglomerulonephritis, and neurodevelopmental delay. A definitive diagnosis can be made through\ngenetic testing. Current standard of care includes antimicrobial prophylaxis (e.g.,\ntrimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin), immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IRT),\nimmunosuppressive therapy (e.g., glucocorticoids, rituximab), and hematopoietic stem cell\ntransplant (HSCT).4\n2.
