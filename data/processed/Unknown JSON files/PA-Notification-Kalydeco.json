Background:\nKalydeco® (ivacaftor) is a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator\nindicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 1 months and older who have at\nleast one mutation in the CFTR gene that is responsive to ivacaftor based on clinical and/or in vitro\nassay data.\nIf the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect the\npresence of a CFTR mutation followed by verification with bi-directional sequencing when\nrecommended by the mutation test instructions for use. 1\nMembers will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.\n2. Coverage Criteriaa:\nA. Initial Authorization\n1. Kalydeco will be approved based upon both of the following criteria:\na. Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF)\n-AND-\nb. Documentation confirming that patient has at least one of the following mutations in the\nCFTR gene that is responsive to Kalydeco^:\n^List of CFTR gene mutations responsive to Kalydeco. A complete up to date list of responsive mutations\ncan be referenced in the Kalydeco Prescribing Information.\n711+3A→G * F311del I148T R75Q S589N\n2789+5G→A * F311L I175V R117C * S737F\n3272-26A→G * F508C I807M R117G S945L *\n3849+10kbC→T * F508C;S1251N † I1027T R117H * S977F *\nA120T F1052V I1139V R117L S1159F\n© 2025 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\nA234D F1074L K1060T R117P S1159P\nA349V G178E L206W * R170H S1251N *\nA455E * G178R * L320V R347H * S1255P *\nA1067T G194R L967S R347L T338I\nD110E G314E L997F R352Q * T1053I\nD110H G551D * L1480P R553Q V232D\nD192G G551S * M152V R668C V562I\nD579G * G576A M952I R792G V754M\nD924N G970D M952T R933G V1293G\nD1152H * G1069R P67L * R1070Q W1282R\nD12",

Reauthorization\n1. Kalydeco will be approved based on the following criterion:\na. Documentation of positive clinical response to Kalydeco therapy (e.g., improved lung\nfunction, stable lung function)\nAuthorization will be issued for 12 months.\na State mandates may apply.

Additional Clinical Rules:\n• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization\nbased solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.\nUse of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.\n• Medical Necessity and/or Supply limits may be in place.\n4.
