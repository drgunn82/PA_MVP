Background:\nVonjo (pacritinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adults with intermediate or\nhigh-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia)\nmyelofibrosis (MF) with a platelet count below 50 × 109/L.\nThe National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) recommends Vonjo in higher-risk MF\nif not a transplant candidate and platelets <50 × 109/L or platelets ≥50 x 109/L with presence of\nsymptomatic splenomegaly and/or constitutional symptoms with or without a response or loss\nof response to one prior Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. NCCN also recommends Vonjo for the\ntreatment of symptomatic lower-risk MF and platelets <50 × 109/L with or without a response\nor loss of response to ruxolitinib, peginterferon alfa-2a, momelotinib, or hydroxyurea. NCCN\nalso recommends Vonjo in MF-associated anemia, and in accelerated/blast phase\nmyeloproliferative neoplasms as conditioning therapy in transplant candidates for the\nimprovement of splenomegaly and other disease-related symptoms, and as palliation of\nsplenomegaly or other disease-related symptoms in combination with hypomethylating agents\nas bridging therapy prior to transplant, or if not a candidate for transplant.\nCoverage Information:\nMembers will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage.
