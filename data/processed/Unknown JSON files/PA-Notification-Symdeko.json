Background:\nSymdeko is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, indicated for the treatment of patients with\ncystic fibrosis (CF) age 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or who\nhave at least one mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)\ngene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro data and/or clinical evidence.\nIf the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect\nthe presence of a CFTR mutation followed by verification with bi-directional sequencing when\nrecommended by the mutation test instructions for use.\nMembers will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.\n2. Coverage Criteriaa:\nA. Initial Authorization\n1. Symdeko will be approved based on all of the following criteria:\na. Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF)\n-AND-\nb. One of the following:\n(1) Documentation confirming the patient is homozygous for the F508del mutation in\nthe CFTR gene.\n-OR-\n(2) Documentation confirming the patient has at least one of the following mutations\nin the CFTR gene that is responsive to Symdeko^:\n^List of CFTR gene mutations responsive to Symdeko.
