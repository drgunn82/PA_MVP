Background:\nLumryz, Xyrem® (sodium oxybate) and XywavTM are central nervous system depressants indicated\nfor the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy.\nXyway is also indicated for idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) in adults.\nLumryz, Xyrem and Xywav are classified as a Schedule III controlled substance by Federal law. The\nactive ingredient, sodium oxybate or gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), is listed in the most restrictive\nschedule of the Controlled Substances Act (Schedule I). Thus, non-medical uses are classified under\nSchedule I.\nLumryz, Xyrem and Xywav are available only through a REMS program with restricted\ndistribution. The REMS Program provides educational materials to the prescriber and the patient\nexplaining the risks and proper use of Lumryz, Xyrem and Xywav, and the required prescription\nform. Once it is documented that the patient has read and/or understood the materials, the drug will\nbe shipped to the patient. The REMS Program also recommends patient follow-up every 3 months.\nPhysicians are expected to report all serious adverse events to the manufacturer.\nMembers will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.\n© 2023 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\n2.
