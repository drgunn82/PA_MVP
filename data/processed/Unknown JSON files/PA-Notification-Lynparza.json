Background:\nLynparza (olaparib) is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor indicated for the\nmaintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic\nBRCA-mutated (gBRCAm or sBRCAm) advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary\nperitoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.\nLynparza is also indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial\novarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, who are in complete or partial response to\nplatinum-based chemotherapy. Lynparza is also indicated in combination with bevacizumab for the\nmaintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary\nperitoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy\nand whose cancer is associated with homologous recombination deficiency (HRD)-positive status\ndefined by either: a deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA mutation or genomic instability.\nLynparza is also indicated in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm, human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative high risk early, recurrent, or metastatic breast\ncancer who have been treated with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or, in the setting of\nmetastatic breast cancer, the metastatic setting. Patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast\ncancer should have been treated with a prior endocrine therapy or be considered inappropriate for\nendocrine treatment. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends\nLynparza therapy in patients with del",

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends\nLynparza therapy in patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious gBRCAm human epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive recurrent unresectable or metastatic breast cancer. Patients\nwith high risk early breast cancer should continue treatment for a total of 1 year, or until disease\nrecurrence, or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.\nLynparza is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious\ngermline or somatic homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated metastatic castration-\nresistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide\nor abiraterone. Lynparza is also indicated in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or\nprednisolone for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA-\nmutated (BRCAm) mCRPC. Patients receiving Lynparza for mCRPC should also receive a\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog concurrently or should have had a bilateral\norchiectomy.\nLynparza is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with deleterious or suspected\ndeleterious gBRCAm metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma whose disease has not progressed on at\nleast 16 weeks of a first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.\nThe NCCN also recommends Lynparza therapy in patients with uterine sarcoma as single-agent\nsecond-line therapy.\n© 2024 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\nCoverage Information:\nMembers will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage.
