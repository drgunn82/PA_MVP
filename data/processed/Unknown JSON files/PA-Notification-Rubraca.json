Background:\nRubraca (rucaparib) is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor indicated for the\nmaintenance treatment of adult patients with a deleterious BRCA mutation (germline and/or\nsomatic)-associated recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who\nare in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy.\nRubraca is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with deleterious BRCA mutation\n(germline and/or somatic)-associated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who\nhave been treated with androgen receptor-directed therapy and a taxane-based chemotherapy. This\nindication is approved under accelerated approval based on objective response rate and duration of\nresponse. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and\ndescription of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends Rubraca for castration-\nresistant distant metastatic prostate cancer for patients who have a pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2\nmutation (germline and/or somatic) and have been treated with androgen receptor-directed\ntherapy. The NCCN also recommends Rubraca as second-line therapy that may be considered for\nBRCA altered uterine leiomyosarcoma (uLMS). The NCCN also recommends Rubraca as\nmaintenance therapy for metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma in patients with germline or\nsomatic BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutations if good performance status (ECOG 0-1) and no disease\nprogression (after at least 4-6 months of chemotherapy, assuming acceptable tolerance) following\nthe most recent platinum-based chemotherapy.\nCoverage Information:\nMembers will be required to meet the criteria be",
