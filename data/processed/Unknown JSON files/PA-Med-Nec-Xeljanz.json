Background:\nXeljanz/Xeljanz XR (tofacitinib) is an inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) indicated for the\ntreatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have\nhad an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\nblockers. It may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other non-\nbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).1 Examples of non-biologic\nDMARDs commonly used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis include methotrexate,\nleflunomide, and sulfasalazine.2,3 Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR is also indicated for the treatment of\nadult patients with active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis, and moderately to\nseverely active ulcerative colitis, who have an inadequate response or intolerance to one or\nmore TNF blockers. Xeljanz/Xeljanz Oral Solution is indicated for the treatment of active\npolyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and older who have had an\ninadequate response or intolerance to one or more TNF blockers.\nLimitations of Use:\nThe use of Xeljanz/Xeljanz XR/Xeljanz Oral Solution in combination with biologic DMARDs or\nwith potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not recommended.\n2.
