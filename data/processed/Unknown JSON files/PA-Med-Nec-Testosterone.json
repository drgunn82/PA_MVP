Primary\nhypogonadism originates from a deficiency or disorder in the testicles. Secondary\nhypogonadism indicates a problem in the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland. Testosterone\nuse has been strongly linked to improvements in muscle mass, bone density, and libido.\nThe purpose of this program is to provide coverage for androgens and anabolic steroid therapy\nfor the treatment of conditions for which they have shown to be effective and are within the\nscope of the plan’s pharmacy benefit. Coverage for the enhancement of athletic performance\nor body building will not be provided.\n2. Coverage Criteriaa:\nA. Initial Authorization for Hypogonadism\n1.
