Background:\nTymlos (abaloparatide) is a human parathyroid hormone analog indicated for the treatment of\npostmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture or patients who have failed or\nare intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. Tymlos is also indicated to increase bone\ndensity in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture or patients who have failed or are\nintolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy.1\nThe American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology\n(AACE/ACE) recommend the use of abaloparatide in patients unable to use oral therapy and as\ninitial therapy for patients at very high fracture risk defined as the following: patients with a\nrecent fracture (e.g., within the past 12 months), fractures while on approved osteoporosis\ntherapy, multiple fractures, fractures while on drugs causing skeletal harm (e.g., long-term\nglucocorticoids), very low T-score (e.g., less than −3.0), high risk for falls or history of\ninjurious falls, and very high fracture probability by FRAX® (fracture risk assessment tool)\n(e.g., major osteoporosis fracture >30%, hip fracture >4.5%) or other validated fracture risk\nalgorithm to be at very high fracture risk.2 Additionally, the AACE/ACE and Endocrine Society\nboth recommend to limit treatment with abaloparatide to 2 years.2-3\nThe safety and efficacy of Tymlos have not been evaluated beyond 2 years of treatment.\nCumulative use of Tymlos and other parathyroid hormone analogs (e.g., Forteo, Teriparatide\nInjection) for more than 2 years during a patient’s lifetime is not recommended.1-3\nCoverage will be provided for members who meet the following criteria.\n2.
