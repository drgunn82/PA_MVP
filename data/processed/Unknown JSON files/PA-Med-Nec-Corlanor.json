Background:\nCorlanor (ivabradine) is a hyperpolarization-activated cycle nucleotide-gated channel blocker\nindicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for worsening of heart failure in patients with\nstable, symptomatic chronic heart failure with left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, who are\nin sinus rhythm with resting heart rate > 70 beats per minute and either are on maximally\ntolerated doses of beta-blockers or have a contraindication to beta-blocker use. It is also\nindicated to treat stable symptomatic heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in\npediatric patients aged 6 months and older, who are in sinus rhythm with an elevated heart rate.\nAlso, although not an FDA-approved indication, Corlanor has also shown to have efficacy in\ntreating inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST).\n2. Coverage Criteriaa:\nA. Initial Authorization\n1. Corlanor will be approved based on one of the following criteria:\na.
