Background:\nMekinist® (trametinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated as a single agent or in combination with\nTafinlar® (dabrafenib) for treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with\nBRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutations as detected by an FDA-approved test. It is also\nindicated in combination with Tafinlar for the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC) with BRAF V600E mutation as detected by an FDA approved test, for the adjuvant\ntreatment of melanoma with BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutations, as detected by an FDA-\napproved test, involving the lymph nodes following resection, for the treatment of locally\nadvanced or metastatic anaplastic thyroid cancer with BRAF V600E mutation with no satisfactory\nlocoregional treatment options, and for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age\nand older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have\nprogressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. The\nlatter indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and\nduration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification\nand description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). Mekinist, in combination with\nTafinlar, is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with low-\ngrade glioma (LGG) with a BRAF V600E mutation who require systemic therapy.\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends use of Mekinist in\ncombination with Tafinlar for the adjuvant treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer with BRAF\nV600E mutati",
