Background:\nAyvakit (avapritinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of adults with unresectable or\nmetastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) harboring a platelet-derived growth factor receptor\nalpha (PDGFRA) exon 18 mutation, including PDGFRA D842V mutations. Ayvakit is indicated for\nthe treatment of adult patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM), including patients with\naggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematological\nneoplasm (SM-AHN), and mast cell leukemia (MCL). Ayvakit is not recommended for the treatment\nof patients with AdvSM with platelet counts of less than 50 x 109/L. Ayvakit is also indicated for the\ntreatment of indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM). Ayvakit is not recommended for the treatment of\npatients with ISM with platelet counts of less than 50 X 109/L.\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends use as single agent therapy\nas continued treatment for limited progression of GIST, for unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic\ndisease after failure on approved therapies. Additionally, NCCN recommends use for treatment of\nGIST with PDGFRA exon 18 mutations, including the PDGFRA D842V mutation, for disease that is\nunresectable, recurrent, metastatic, gross residual disease (R2 resection), or as treatment for resectable\ndisease with significant morbidity that is insensitive to imatinib.\nThe NCCN also recommends use of Ayvakit for treatment for myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with\neosinophilia and FIP1L1-PDGFRA rearrangement if PDGFRA D842V mutation is found which is\nresistant to imatinib.\nCoverage Information:\nMembers will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage. For members under the age of 19\nyears, th",
