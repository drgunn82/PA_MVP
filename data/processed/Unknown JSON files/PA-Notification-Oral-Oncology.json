Background:\nThe coverage criteria below provides parameters for coverage of specific oral oncology\nmedications covered under the pharmacy benefit based upon the National Comprehensive\nCancer Network (NCCN) Drugs & Biologics Compendium™. The Compendium lists the\nappropriate drugs and biologics for specific cancers using U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA)-approved disease indications and specific NCCN panel recommendations. Each\nrecommendation is supported by a level of evidence category.\nUnitedHealthcare recognizes indications and uses of oral oncology medications listed in the\nNCCN Drugs and Biologics Compendium with Categories of Evidence and Consensus of 1,\n2A, and 2B as proven and Categories of Evidence and Consensus of 3 as unproven.\nUnitedHealthcare will cover all chemotherapy agents for individuals under the age of 19 years.\nThe majority of pediatric patients receive treatments on national pediatric protocols that are\nsimilar in concept to the NCCN patient care guidelines.\nAdditional Information:\nThe NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) are a\ncomprehensive set of guidelines detailing the sequential management decisions and\ninterventions that currently apply to more than 97 percent of cancers affecting patients in the\nUnited States. In addition, separate guidelines provide recommendations for some of the key\ncancer prevention and screening topics as well as supportive care considerations, and specific\npopulations. The guidelines are developed and updated by 60 individual panels, comprising\nover 1,700 clinicians and oncology researchers from the 31 NCCN member institutions.\nNCCN categ",
    ", and specific\npopulations. The guidelines are developed and updated by 60 individual panels, comprising\nover 1,700 clinicians and oncology researchers from the 31 NCCN member institutions.\nNCCN categories for recommendations are based on both the level of clinical evidence\navailable and the degree of consensus within the NCCN Guidelines panel. Evidence of both\nefficacy and safety of interventions is considered by the panel.\nThe level of evidence for each recommendation depends upon the following factors:\n• Quality of data based on trial design and how the results/observations were derived (e.g.,\nrandomized controlled trials [RCTs], non-RCTs, meta-analyses or systematic reviews,\nclinical case reports, case series)\n• Quantity of data (e.g., number of trials, size of trials, clinical observations only),\n• Consistency of data (e.g., similar, or conflicting results across available studies or\nobservations)\n© 2024 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\nNCCN Categories of Evidence and Consensus:\nCategory 1: The recommendation is based on high-level evidence (i.e., high-powered\nrandomized clinical trials or meta-analyses), and the panel has reached uniform NCCN\nconsensus (majority panel vote of at least 85%) that the intervention is appropriate.\nCategory 2A: The recommendation is based on lower-level evidence, but despite the absence\nof higher-level studies, there is uniform NCCN consensus (majority panel vote of at least 85%)\nthat the intervention is appropriate.\nCategory 2B: The recommendation is based on lower-level evidence, and there is NCCN\nconsensus (majority panel vote of at least 50%, but less than 85%) that the intervention is\nappropriate.\nCategory 3: Based on any level of evidence, regardless of the quality of evidence, there is\nmajor NCCN disagreement that the intervention is appropriate (a panel vote of at least 25% to\ninclude and designate a recommendation as Category 3 is required).\nCoverage Information:\nMembers will be required to meet the criteria below for cov",

For members under the age\nof 19 years, the prescription will automatically process without a coverage review.\nSome states mandate benefit coverage for off-label use of medications for some diagnoses or\nunder some circumstances. Some states also mandate usage of other Compendium references.\nWhere such mandates apply, they supersede language in the benefit document or in the\nnotification criteria.\n2. Coverage Criteria:\nA. Select oral chemotherapeutic agents will be approved based on one of the following\ncriteria:\n1. Patient is under the age of 19 years\n-OR-\n2. The drug has been recognized for treatment of the cancer indication by The National\nComprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Drugs and Biologics Compendium with a\nCategory of Evidence and Consensus of 1, 2A, or 2B\n-OR-\n3. Patient is receiving treatment for a non-oncology indication that is recognized in the\nproduct labeling, a published compendium (e.g., Micromedex, Clinical Pharmacology),\nor is demonstrated as proven in the peer reviewed medical literature.\nAuthorization will be issued for 12 months.\n3. Additional Clinical Rules:\n• Supply limits and/or step therapy may be in place for certain products.\n© 2024 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n2\n• Requests for initial therapy established via receipt of a manufacturer supplied sample or any\nother form of assistance shall be required to meet coverage criteria.\n4.
