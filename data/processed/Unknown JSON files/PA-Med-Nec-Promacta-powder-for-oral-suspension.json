    "UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy\nClinical Pharmacy Programs\nProgram Number 2024 P 2348-1\nProgram Prior Authorization/Medical Necessity\nMedication *Promacta® (eltrombopag) for oral suspension\n*This program applies to the formulation for oral suspension\nP&T Approval Date 8/2024\nEffective Date 1/1/2025\n1. Background:\nPromacta (eltrombopag) is a thrombopoietin receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of\nthrombocytopenia in adult and pediatric patients 1 year and older with persistent or chronic\nimmune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who have experienced an insufficient response to\ncorticosteroids, immunoglobulins, or splenectomy. Promacta is indicated for the treatment of\nthrombocytopenia in patients with chronic hepatitis C to allow the initiation and maintenance of\ninterferon-based therapy. Promacta is also approved in combination with standard\nimmunosuppressive therapy for the first line treatment of adult and pediatric patients 2 years and\nolder with severe aplastic anemia and for the treatment of patients with severe aplastic anemia\nwho have had an insufficient response to immunosuppressive therapy.\nPromacta should be used only in patients with ITP whose degree of thrombocytopenia and\nclinical condition increase the risk for bleeding.\nPromacta should be used only in patients with chronic hepatitis C whose degree of\nthrombocytopenia prevents the initiation of interferon-based therapy or limits the ability to\nmaintain interferon-based therapy. Safety and efficacy have not been established in\ncombination with direct-acting antiviral agents used without interferon for treatment of\nchronic hepatitis C infection.\nMembers will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.\n2.
