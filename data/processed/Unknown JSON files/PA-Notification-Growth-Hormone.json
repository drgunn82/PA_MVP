Background:\nSomatropin (Genotropin®*, Humatrope®*, Norditropin®, Nutropin AQ NuSpin®*, Omnitrope®,\nSaizen®*, Zomacton®*) is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients with growth failure due\nto inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (GH), growth hormone deficiency\n(GHD), short stature associated with Turner syndrome or Noonan syndrome, idiopathic short\nstature (ISS), short-stature or growth failure in short stature homeobox-containing gene\nhomeobox (SHOX) gene deficiency, growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome, short stature in\nchildren born small for gestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth by 2 years to 4 years of\nage, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) up to the time of renal transplantation., growth failure in\nchildren with chronic renal insufficiency up to the time of transplant, short bowel syndrome in\npatients receiving specialized nutritional support, and HIV-associated wasting. Somatropin is also\nindicated for replacement of endogenous growth hormone (GH) in adults with confirmed GH\ndeficiency (GHD).\nNgenla™ (somatrogon-ghla), is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 3 years and\nolder who have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous GH.\nSkytrofa™ (lonapegsomatropin-tcg",

It is also\nindicated for the replacement of endogenous GD in adults with GHD.\nSerostim® (somatropin) is indicated for the treatment of HIV patients with wasting or cachexia to\nincrease lean body mass and body weight and improve physical endurance.\nZorbtive® (somatropin) is indicated for the treatment of short bowel syndrome in adult patients\nreceiving specialized nutritional support.\n© 2025 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\nIncrelex® (mecasermin) is indicated for the treatment of growth failure in pediatric patients 2\nyears of age and older with severe primary insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) deficiency or with\nGH gene deletion that have developed neutralizing antibodies to GH.\nCoverage Information\nSince short stature in the absence of defined pathology is not a sickness or injury, growth\nhormone is not a covered health service for these indications. The standard UnitedHealthcare\nPharmacy Rider explicitly excludes coverage of growth hormone for short stature caused by\nheredity and not by a diagnosed medical condition.\nCoverage for somatropin (Genotropin*, Humatrope*, Norditropin, Nutropin AQ NuSpin*,\nOmnitrope, Saizen*, Serostim, Zomacton*, Zorbtive), Ngenla, Skytrofa, Sogroya*, and Increlex\nwill be provided for members who meet the following criteria:\n2.

Please refer to plan specifics to determine exclusion\nstatus.\nEssential versus Nonessential Use\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010 includes a mandate that prohibits\nannual dollar maximum limits for “essential” benefits. A strict definition of “essential” was not provided\nin PPACA or in federal health care regulations published as of the date this program was revised.\nUnitedHealthcare defines an “essential” use of growth hormone as therapy to treat a deficiency as part of\nchronic disease management. Other uses such as replacement therapy in a disorder where a deficiency is\nnot noted are considered “nonessential.”\nThis information applies to groups with benefit caps in place for growth hormone therapy. If the diagnosis\nis considered an essential use of the medication, the cap will not apply. For these cases, an override for\nthe cap amount will be entered at the same time the authorization (if criteria met) is entered for the\nmedication. If the diagnosis is a nonessential use of the medication, then only the authorization for the\nmedication will be entered.\n© 2025 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n18\nDiagnosis\nPediatric growth hormone deficiency Essential\nGrowth failure in children small for gestational age Nonessential\nGrowth failure due to chronic renal insufficiency Nonessential\nGrowth failure due to Turner Syndrome Nonessential\nGrowth failure due to Noonan Syndrome Nonessential\nGrowth failure due to short-stature homeobox (SHOX) Nonessential\ngene deficiency\nPrad",
