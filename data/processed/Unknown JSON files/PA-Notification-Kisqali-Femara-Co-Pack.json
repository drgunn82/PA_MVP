    "UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy\nClinical Pharmacy Programs\nProgram Number 2025 P 1260-9\nProgram Prior Authorization/Notification\nMedication Kisqali® Femara® Co-Pack (ribociclib/letrozole)\nP&T Approval Date 9/2018, 9/2019, 9/2020, 9/2021, 2/2022, 2/2023, 2/2024, 11/2024,\n6/2025\nEffective Date 8/1/2025\n1. Background:\nKisqali® Femara® Co-Pack is a co-packaged product containing ribociclib, a kinase inhibitor,\nand letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, and is indicated as initial endocrine-based therapy for the\ntreatment of adult patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth\nfactor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Kisqali is also\nindicated for use in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the adjuvant treatment of\nadults with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\n(HER2)-negative stage II and III early breast cancer at high risk of recurrence.\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends the use of Kisqali\nsimilarly for men and premenopausal women receiving ovarian ablation/suppression with\nrecurrent unresectable (local or regional) or metastatic HR-positive HER2-negative breast\ncancer disease in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant. The use of an\naromatase inhibitor in men with breast cancer is ineffective without concomitant suppression of\ntesticular steroidogenesis. The NCCN also recommends Kisqali for estrogen receptor (ER)-\npositive recurrent or metastatic endometrial carcinoma in combination with letrozole.\nCoverage Information:\nMembers will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage.
