Background:\nSomatropin (Genotropin®*, Humatrope®*, Norditropin®, Nutropin AQ NuSpin®*, Omnitrope®,\nSaizen®*, Zomacton®*) is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients with growth failure due to\ninadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (GH), growth hormone deficiency (GHD), short\nstature associated with Turner syndrome or Noonan syndrome, idiopathic short stature (ISS), short-\nstature or growth failure in short stature homeobox-containing gene homeobox (SHOX) gene\ndeficiency, growth failure due to Prader-Willi syndrome, short stature in children born small for\ngestational age (SGA) with no catch-up growth by 2 years to 4 years of age, and chronic kidney\ndisease (CKD) up to the time of renal transplantation., growth failure in children with chronic renal\ninsufficiency up to the time of transplant, short bowel syndrome in patients receiving specialized\nnutritional support, and HIV-associated wasting. Somatropin is also indicated for replacement of\nendogenous growth hormone (GH) in adults with confirmed GH deficiency (GHD).\nNgenla™ (somatrogon-ghla), is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 3 years and\nolder who have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous GH.\nSkytrofa™ (lonapegsomatropin-tcgd) is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year and\nolder who weigh at least 11.5",

It is also\nindicated for the replacement of endogenous GD in adults with GHD.\nSerostim® (somatropin) is indicated for the treatment of HIV patients with wasting or cachexia to\nincrease lean body mass and body weight and improve physical endurance.\nZorbtive® (somatropin) is indicated for the treatment of short bowel syndrome in adult patients\nreceiving specialized nutritional support.\nIncrelex® (mecasermin) is indicated for the treatment of growth failure in pediatric patients 2 years\nof age and older with severe primary insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) deficiency or with GH\ngene deletion who have developed neutralizing antibodies to GH.\n© 2025 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\nCoverage Information\nSince short stature in the absence of defined pathology is not a sickness or injury, growth hormone is\nnot a covered health service for these indications. The standard UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy Rider\nexplicitly excludes coverage of growth hormone for short stature caused by heredity and not by a\ndiagnosed medical condition.\nCoverage for somatropin (Genotropin*, Humatrope*, Norditropin, Nutropin AQ NuSpin*,\nOmnitrope, Saizen*, Serostim, Zomacton, Zorbtive), Ngenla, Skytrofa, Sogroya*, and Increlex will\nbe provided for members who meet the following criteria:\n2.

Please refer to plan specifics to determine exclusion\nstatus.\nEssential versus Nonessential Use\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010 includes a mandate that prohibits\nannual dollar maximum limits for “essential” benefits. A strict definition of “essential” was not provided\nin PPACA or in federal health care regulations published as of the date this program was revised.\nUnitedHealthcare defines an “essential” use of growth hormone as therapy to treat a deficiency as part of\nchronic disease management. Other uses such as replacement therapy in a disorder where a deficiency is\nnot noted are considered “nonessential.”\nThis information applies to groups with benefit caps in place for growth hormone therapy.
