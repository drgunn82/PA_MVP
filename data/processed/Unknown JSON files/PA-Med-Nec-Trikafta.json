Background:\nTrikafta is a combination of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor, indicated for the treatment of\npatients with cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 2 years and older who have at least one F508del\nmutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or a mutation in\nthe CFTR gene that is responsive based on clinical and/or in vitro data.\nIf the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to confirm the\npresence of at least one indicated mutation.\nMembers will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.\n2. Coverage Criteriaa:\nA. Initial Authorization\n1. Trikafta will be approved based upon all of the following criteria:\na. Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF)\n-AND-\nb. Submission of laboratory results documenting that the patient has at least one of the\nfollowing responsive mutations in the CFTR gene:*\n(1) F508del mutation\n(2) A mutation that is responsive based on clinical data\n(3) A mutation that is responsive based on in vitro data\n(4) A mutation that is responsive based on extrapolated data\n*List of CFTR gene mutations responsive to Trikafta.

Trikafta will be approved based on the following criterion:\na. Documentation of positive clinical response to Trikafta therapy (e.g., improved lung\nfunction, stable lung function)\nAuthorization will be issued for 12 months.\na State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific benefit\nplan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization management\nprograms may apply.\n3. Additional Clinical Rules:\n• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization\nbased solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.\nUse of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.\n• Supply limits may be in place.\n4.
