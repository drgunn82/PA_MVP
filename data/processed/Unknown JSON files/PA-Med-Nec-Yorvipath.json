Background:\nYorvipath® is a parathyroid hormone analog (PTH(1-34)) indicated for the treatment of\nhypoparathyroidism in adults.\nConventional therapy for hypoparathyroidism consists of active vitamin D (e.g., calcitriol or its\nanalog alfacalcidol) and calcium supplementation.\nLimitations of Use:\n• Yorvipath was not studied for acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism.\n• Titration scheme was only evaluated in adults who first achieved an albumin-corrected serum\ncalcium of at least 7.8 mg/dL using calcium and active vitamin D treatment.\n2. Coverage Criteriaa:\nA. Initial Authorization\n1. Yorvipath will be approved based on all of the following criteria:\na. Diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism\n-AND-\nb. Confirmation of initial diagnosis by both of the following:\n(1) Pretreatment low albumin‐corrected serum calcium (i.e., ≤ 8.5 mg/dL)\nconfirmed on at least two occasions separated by at least 2 weeks\n-AND-\n(2) Pretreatment undetectable or inappropriately low intact parathyroid (PTH)\nconcentration (i.e., < 20 pg/mL), by second- or third-generation\nimmunoassay, on at least two occasions\n-AND-\nc. Yorvipath is not being used to treat acute post-surgical hypoparathyroidism\n-AND-\n© 2024 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\nd. Patient is currently on adequate supplemental calcium and active vitamin D\n(e.g., calcitriol) therapy as evidenced by both of the following:\n(1) Albumin‐corrected serum calcium 7.8–10.6 mg/dL\n(2) Serum 25(OH) vitamin D 20–80 ng/mL\n-AND-\ne. Prescribed by one of the following:\n(1) Endocrinologist\n(2) Nephrologist\nAuthorization will be issued for 12 months\nB. Reauthorization\n1. Yorvipath will be approved based on all of the following criteria:\na. Documentation of positive clinical response [e.g., albumin-corrected serum\ncalcium level in normal range ",
    "hs\nB. Reauthorization\n1. Yorvipath will be approved based on all of the following criteria:\na. Documentation of positive clinical response [e.g., albumin-corrected serum\ncalcium level in normal range (approximately 8.3-10.6 mg/dL), independence\nfrom conventional therapy (e.g., requiring no active vitamin D, ≤ 600 mg/day of\ncalcium)]\n-AND-\nb. Prescribed by one of the following:\n(1) Endocrinologist\n(2) Nephrologist\nAuthorization will be issued for 12 months\na State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific\nbenefit plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization\nmanagement programs may apply.\n3. Additional Clinical Rules:\n• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-\nauthorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10)\nand/or claim logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program\nand/or therapeutic class.\n4. References:\n1. Yorvipath® [package insert].
