Resistant hypertension (RH) is defined\nas above-goal elevated blood pressure (BP) in a patient despite the concurrent use of 3\nantihypertensive drug classes, commonly including a long-acting calcium channel blocker, a\nblocker of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin\nreceptor blocker), and a diuretic. The antihypertensive drugs should be administered at maximum\nor maximally tolerated daily doses.1\nTryvio is only available through a restricted distribution program called the Tryvio REMS.\n2. Coverage Criteriaa:\nA. Initial Authorization\n1. Tryvio will be approved based on all of the following criteria:\na. Diagnosis of resistant hypertension\n-AND-\nb. One of the following:\n1) Systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg on two consecutive measurements despite\nmaximally tolerated antihypertensive treatment\n-OR-\n2) Diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg on two consecutive measurements despite\nmaximally tolerated antihypertensive treatment\n-AND-\nc. Patient has been previously treated with all of the following antihypertensive classes\nfor an adequate duration (minimum 4 weeks each) at a maximally tolerated dose:\n1) Maximally tolerated blocker of the renin-angiotensin system [angiotensin-\nconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (e.g., enalapril, lisinopril) or angiotensin II\nreceptor blocker (ARB) (e.g., candesartan, valsartan)]\n© 2025 UnitedHealthcare Services Inc.\n1\n2) Maximally tolerated calcium channel blocker (e.g., amlodipine, diltiazem,\nverapamil)\n3) Maximally tolerated d",

Provider attests other causes of hypertension have been excluded (e.g., secondary\ncauses [e.g., primary hyperaldosteronism], white coat effect, medication\nnonadherence)\n-AND-\ne. Used as an adjunct to lifestyle modification (e.g., dietary or caloric restriction,\nexercise, behavioral support, community-based program)\n-AND-\nf. Tryvio will be used in combination with at least 3 antihypertensive medications from\ndifferent classes at maximally tolerated doses\n-AND-\ng. Prescribed by or in consultation with a specialist experienced in the treatment of\nresistant hypertension (e.g., cardiologist, nephrologist)\nAuthorization will be issued for 12 months\nB. Reauthorization\n1. Tryvio will be approved based on both of the following criteria:\na. Documentation the patient is receiving clinical benefit to Tryvio therapy\n-AND-\nb.
