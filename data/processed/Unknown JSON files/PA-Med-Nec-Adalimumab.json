Background:\nAdalimumab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blocker indicated for:\n• Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA): reducing signs and symptoms, inducing major clinical response,\ninhibiting the progression of structural damage, and improving physical function in adult patients\nwith moderately to severely active RA. Adalimumab can be used alone or in combination with\nmethotrexate or other non-biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).\n• Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA): reducing signs and symptoms of moderately to severely active\npolyarticular JIA in patients 2 years of age and older. Adalimumab can be used alone or in\ncombination with methotrexate.\n• Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural\ndamage, and improving physical function in adult patients with active Ps",
    "mbination with methotrexate.\n• Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): reducing signs and symptoms, inhibiting the progression of structural\ndamage, and improving physical function in adult patients with active PsA.\n• Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS): reducing signs and symptoms in adult patients with active AS.\nAdalimumab can be used alone or in combination with non-biologic DMARDs.\n• Crohn’s Disease (CD): treatment of moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease in adults and\npediatric patients 6 years of age and older.\n• Ulcerative Colitis (UC): treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults and\npediatric patients 5 years of age and older.\n• Plaque Psoriasis (Ps): treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis\nwho are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, and when other systemic therapies are\nmedically less appropriate.\n• Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS): treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa in\npatients 12 years of age and older.\n• Uveitis (UV): treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior, and panuveitis in adults and\npediatric patients 2 years of age and older.\n© 2025 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\nIn ulcerative colitis, effectiveness has not been established in patients who have lost response to or\nwere intolerant to TNF blockers.\n2.
