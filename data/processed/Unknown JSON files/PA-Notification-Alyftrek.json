Background:\nAlyftrek is a combination of deutivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, tezacaftor, and vanzacaftor\nindicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at\nleast one F508del mutation or another responsive mutation in the CFTR gene.\nIf the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to\nconfirm the presence of at least one indicated mutation.\nMembers will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.\n2. Coverage Criteriaa:\nA. Initial Authorization\n1. Alyftrek will be approved based upon all of the following criteria:\na. Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF)\n-AND-\nb. Documentation confirming the patient has at least one of the following responsive\nmutations in the CFTR gene*:\n(1) F508del mutation\n(2) A mutation that is responsive based on clinical data\n(3) A mutation that is responsive based on in vitro data\n(4) A mutation that is responsive based on extrapolation data\n*List of CFTR gene mutations responsive to Alyftrek. A complete up to date list of responsive mutations\ncan be referenced in the Alyftrek Prescribing Information.\nBased on clinical data**\nA455E G551D L1077P† R352Q S549N V754M\nD1152H G85E† L206W R75Q S549R W1098C†\nF508del† H1054D M1101K† S1159F S945L W1282R\nG1244E I336K R1066H S1251N V562I Y563N†\nBased on in vitro data‡\n1507_1515del9 E116Q G424S I556V P140S R334L T1053I\n2183A→G E193K G463V I601F P205S R334Q T1086I\n3141del9 E292K G480C I618T P499A R347H T1246I\n© 2025 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\n3195del6 E403D G480S I807M P5L R347L T1299I\n3199del6 E474K G551A I980K P574H R347P T338I\n546insCTA E56K G551S K1060T P67L R352W T351I\nA1006E E588V G576A K162E P750L R516G T604I\nA1067P E60K G576A; K464E P99L R516S V1153E\nR668C§\nA1067T E822K G622D L1011",

The patient is ≥ 6 years of age\nAuthorization will be issued for 12 months.\nB. Reauthorization\n1. Alyftrek will be approved based on the following criterion:\na. Documentation of positive clinical response to Alyftrek therapy (e.g., improved lung\nfunction, stable lung function)\nAuthorization will be issued for 12 months.\na State mandates may apply. Any federal regulatory requirements and the member specific\nbenefit plan coverage may also impact coverage criteria. Other policies and utilization\nmanagement programs may apply.\n3. Additional Clinical Rules:\n• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-\nauthorization based solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10)\nand/or claim logic. Use of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program\nand/or therapeutic class.\n• Medical Necessity, Supply limits may be in place.\n4. References:\n1. Alyftrek [package insert].
