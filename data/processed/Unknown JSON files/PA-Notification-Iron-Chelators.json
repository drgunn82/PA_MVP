Background:\nExjade® (deferasirox) and Jadenu® (deferasirox) are iron chelating agents indicated for the\ntreatment of chronic iron overload due to blood transfusions (transfusional hemosiderosis) in\npatients 2 years\nof age and older. The safety and efficacy of Exjade and Jadenu, when administered with other\niron chelation therapy, have not been established. It is recommended that therapy with Exjade or\nJadenu be started when a patient has evidence of chronic transfusional iron overload, such as the\ntransfusion of approximately 100 mL/kg of packed red blood cells (approximately 20 units for a\n40-kg patient) and a serum ferritin consistently >1000 mcg/L. Exjade and Jadenu are also\nindicated for the treatment of chronic iron overload in patients 10 years of age and older with\nnon-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT) syndromes and with a liver iron (Fe)\nconcentration (LIC) of at least 5 mg Fe per gram of dry weight (mg Fe/g dw) and a serum\nferritin greater than 300 mcg/L. This indication is based on achievement of an LIC less than 5\nmg Fe/g dw.\nFerriprox® (deferiprone) is an iron chelator indicated for the treatment of transfusional iron\noverload in adult and pediatric patients with thalassemia syndromes, sickle cell disease or other\nanemias. Ferriprox Tablets are indicated in patients ≥ 8 years of age and Ferriprox Oral Solution\nis indicated in patients ≥ 3 years of age.
