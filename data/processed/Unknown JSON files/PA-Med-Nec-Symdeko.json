Background:\nSymdeko is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, indicated for the treatment of patients\nwith cystic fibrosis (CF) age 6 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation\nor who have at least one mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator\n(CFTR) gene that is responsive to tezacaftor/ivacaftor based on in vitro data and/or clinical\nevidence.\nIf the patient’s genotype is unknown, an FDA-cleared CF mutation test should be used to detect\nthe presence of a CFTR mutation followed by verification with bi-directional sequencing when\nrecommended by the mutation test instructions for use.\nMembers will be required to meet the coverage criteria below.\n2. Coverage Criteriaa:\nA. Initial Authorization\n1. Symdeko will be approved based upon all of the following criteria:\na. Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF)\n-AND-\nb. Submission of laboratory results documenting one of the following:\n(1) The patient is homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene.\n-OR-\n(2) The patient has at least one of the following mutations in the CFTR gene that is\nresponsive to Symdeko^:\n^List of CFTR gene mutations responsive to Symdeko.
