Background:\nTafinlar (dabrafenib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients\nwith unresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation as detected by an FDA-\napproved test. Tafinlar is not indicated for treatment of patients with wild-type BRAF solid\ntumors.\nTafinlar, in combination with Mekinist® (trametinib), is indicated for the treatment of patients with\nunresectable or metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutations as detected\nby an FDA-approved test and for the adjuvant treatment of melanoma with BRAF V600E or\nBRAF V600K mutations, as detected by an FDA approved test, involving the lymph node(s),\nfollowing complete resection. Tafinlar, in combination with Mekinist, is indicated for the\ntreatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with BRAF V600E\nmutation as detected by an FDA-approved test, for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic\nanaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) with BRAF V600E mutation and with no satisfactory\nlocoregional treatment options, and for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age\nand older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have\nprogressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. The\nlatter indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and\nduration of response. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification\nand description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). Tafinlar, in combination with\nMekinist, is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age",

Tafinlar, in combination with\nMekinist, is also indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients 1 year of age and older with low-\ngrade glioma (LGG) with a BRAF V600E mutation who require systemic therapy.\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) also recommends use of Tafinlar in\ncombination with Mekinist for the adjuvant treatment of ATC with BRAF V600E mutations\nfollowing resection; and as monotherapy for the treatment of follicular, oncocytic, and papillary\nthyroid carcinomas with a BRAF mutation; in combination with Mekinist for the treatment for\nrecurrent, advanced, or metastatic NSCLC in patients with BRAF V600E mutation, or as single\nagent if the combination of Tafinlar and Mekinist is not tolerated; in the treatment of\nglioblastomas and other high-grade gliomas; in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS)\ncancer in patients with melanoma; ovarian cancer/fallopian tube cancer/primary peritoneal cancer\nwith persistent disease or recurrence in BRAF V600E positive tumors; pancreatic and ampullary\nadenocarcinomas if BRAF V600E mutation positive; certain BRAF V600E mutation positive\nhistiocytic neoplasms and hepatobiliary cancers; hairy cell leukemia; salivary gland tumor; and\ngastrointestinal stromal tumor.\nInformation on FDA-approved tests for the detection of BRAF V600 mutations in melanoma may\nbe found at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics.\nCoverage Information:\n© 2025 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\nMembers will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage.
