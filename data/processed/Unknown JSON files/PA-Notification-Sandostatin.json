    "UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy\nClinical Pharmacy Programs\nProgram Number 2025 P 1091-15\nProgram Prior Authorization/Notification\nMedication Sandostatin® (octreotide acetate)\nNote: Only the subcutaneous formulation of octreotide requires\nnotification. Sandostatin LAR is covered under the medical benefit and\ntherefore addressed in the Somatostatin Analogs drug policy.\nP&T Approval Date 8/2008, 12/2009, 11/2010, 11/2011, 11/2012, 7/2013, 11/2013,\n11/2014, 11/2015, 9/2016, 9/2017, 9/2018, 9/2019, 9/2020, 10/2021,\n1/2022, 1/2023, 1/2024, 2/2025, 4/2025\nEffective Date 5/1/2025\n1. Background:\nSandostatin (octreotide acetate) is indicated to reduce blood levels of growth hormone and IGF-I\n(somatomedin C) in acromegaly patients who have had inadequate response to or cannot be treated\nwith surgical resection, pituitary irradiation and bromocriptine mesylate at maximally tolerated\ndoses. It is also indicated for the symptomatic treatment of patients with metastatic carcinoid\ntumors where it suppresses or inhibits the severe diarrhea and flushing episodes associated with\nthe disease and for the treatment of profuse watery diarrhea associated with vasoactive intestinal\npeptide (VIP)-secreting tumors.\nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends the use of octreotide acetate\nfor the treatment of thyomas and thymic carcinomas as well as meningiomas. The NCCN also\nrecommends octreotide acetate for the treatment of several types of neuroendocrine and adrenal\ntumors, including neuroendocrine tumors of the gastrointestinal tract, lung and thymus,\nneuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas, well-differentiated Grade 3 neuroendocrine tumors, and\npheochromocytoma/paraganglioma. The NCCN Palliative Care Guidelines recommend octreotide\nfor the treatment of chemotherapy and/or radiation-induced diarrhea and malignant bowel\nobstruction.\nClinical evidence supports the use of octreotide acetate as an adjunct to endoscopic therapy for\nbleeding gastroesophageal varices associated with liver",
