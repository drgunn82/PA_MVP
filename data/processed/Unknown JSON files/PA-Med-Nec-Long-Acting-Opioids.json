They are not intended for use as an as needed analgesic.\nLong-acting opioids are not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the\nfirst 12-2",
    "ive treatment\noptions are not appropriate. They are not intended for use as an as needed analgesic.\nLong-acting opioids are not indicated for pain in the immediate postoperative period (the\nfirst 12-24 hours following surgery), or if the pain is mild, or not expected to persist for\nan extended period of time. They are only indicated for postoperative use if the patient is\nalready receiving the drug prior to surgery or if the postoperative pain is expected to be\nmoderate to severe and persist for an extended period of time. Physicians should\nindividualize treatment, moving from parenteral to oral analgesics as appropriate.\n© 2024 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\nLong-acting opioids should not be used in treatment naïve patients. Physicians should\nindividualize treatment in every case, initiating therapy at the appropriate point along a\nprogression from non-opioid analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nand acetaminophen to opioids in a plan of pain management such as those outlined by the\nWorld Health Organization, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the\nFederation of State Medical Boards Model Guidelines, or the American Pain Society.\nThe CDC recommends the following best practices in the prescription of long-acting\nopioids:\n• Nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy are preferred for\nchronic pain.\n• Before starting opioid therapy, treatment goals should be established with patients\nthat include realistic goals for pain and function and should consider how therapy will\nbe discontinued if benefits do not outweigh risks. For some clinical contexts (e.g.,\nheadache or fibromyalgia), the expected benefits of initiating opioids are unlikely to\noutweigh the risks. Track pain and function at every visit (at least every 3 months)\nusing a brief, validated instrument. Continue opioid therapy only if there is clinically\nmeaningful improvement in pain and function that outweighs risks to patient safety.\n• When starting opioid th",
    ")\nusing a brief, validated instrument. Continue opioid therapy only if there is clinically\nmeaningful improvement in pain and function that outweighs risks to patient safety.\n• When starting opioid therapy for chronic pain, clinicians should prescribe immediate-\nrelease opioids instead of extended release/long-acting opioids.\n• Document the daily morphine milligram equivalent (MME) in mg/day from all\nsources of opioids. Access the state prescription drug monitoring program (PDMP)\ndata at treatment initiation and periodically during treatment.\n• Caution should be used when opioids are prescribed with benzodiazepines\nconcurrently. Screen for past and current substance abuse and for severe depression,\nanxiety, and PTSD prior to initiation.\n• Benefits and risks of toxicology testing should be considered to assess for prescribed\nand nonprescribed controlled substances.\n• Avoid escalating doses above 50-90 mg/day MME unless sustained meaningful\nimprovement in pain and function is attained.\n• Clinicians should evaluate benefits and harms of continued therapy at least every 3\nmonths. If benefits do not outweigh harms, physicians should maximize other\ntherapies and work closely with the patients to gradually reduce or taper opioids.\nEvaluation should include assessment of substance use disorder/opioid dependence.\nValidated scales (such as the DAST-10) are available at www.drugabuse.gov.\nSection Overview\nSection 2: Medical Necessity Coverage Criteria for Book of Business\nSection 3: Medical Necessity Coverage Criteria for State of Florida, Maryland, West\nVirginia\nSection 4: Medical Necessity Coverage Criteria for State of Louisiana\n2.
