Background:\nTukysa (tucatinib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated in combination with trastuzumab and\ncapecitabine for treatment of adult patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic human\nepidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, including patients with brain\nmetastases, who have received one or more prior anti-HER2-based regimens in the metastatic\nsetting. Tukysa is also indicated in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of adult\npatients with RAS wild-type HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer that has\nprogressed following treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based\nchemotherapy.\nThe National Cancer Comprehensive Network (NCCN) recommends the use of Tukysa for the\ntreatment of central nervous system cancers (limited and extensive brain metastases) when used in\ncombination with capecitabine and trastuzumab in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer if\npreviously treated with one or more anti-HER2-based regimens. The NCCN also recommends the\nuse of Tukysa in combination with trastuzumab for the treatment of advanced or metastatic\ncolorectal cancer (HER2-amplified and RAS and BRAF wild-type) if intensive therapy not\nrecommended as well as in combination with trastuzumab as subsequent therapy for HER2-\npositive unresectable, resected gross residual (R2), or metastatic biliary tract cancers.\nCoverage Information:\nMembers will be required to meet the criteria below for coverage.
