Background:\nNurtec ODT (rimegepant), Ubrelvy (ubrogepant) and Zavzpret (zavegepant) are calcitonin gene-\nrelated peptide receptor antagonists indicated for the acute treatment of migraine with or without\naura in adults. Nurtec ODT is also indicated for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in\nadults and Qulipta (atogepant) is indicated for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults\nThe American Headache Society recommends the use of NSAIDs (including aspirin), non-\nopioid analgesics, acetaminophen, or caffeinated analgesic combinations (e.g.,\naspirin/acetaminophen/caffeine) for mild‐to‐moderate attacks and migraine‐specific agents\n(i.e.,triptans, dihydroergotamine [DHE]) for moderate or severe attacks and mild‐to‐moderate\nattacks that respond poorly to NSAIDs or caffeinated combinations.\nPreventive treatment selection is based on evidence of efficacy, tolerability, patient preference,\nheadache subtype, and comorbidities. The American Academy of Neurology guidelines note that\nantiepileptic drugs (divalproex sodium, valproate sodium, topiramate) and beta-blockers\n(metoprolol, propranolol, timolol) have established efficacy and that antidepressants\n(amitriptyline, venlafaxine) and beta-blockers (atenolol, nadolol) are probably effective for the\npreventive treatment of migraine headache.\nThis program requires a member to try lower cost options prior to receiving coverage for Nurtec\nODT, Qulipta, Ubrelvy or Zavzpret.\n2.
