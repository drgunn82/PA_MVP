    "UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy\nClinical Pharmacy Programs\nProgram Number 2024 P 1049-12\nProgram Prior Authorization/Notification\nMedication Interim New Product Coverage Criteria\nP&T Approval Date 5/2013, 5/2014, 7/2014, 5/2015, 3/2016, 8/2016, 8/2017, 8/2018,\n8/2019, 8/2020, 8/2021, 10/2023, 12/2024\nEffective Date 3/1/2025\n1. Background:\nThe purpose of this guideline is to establish a procedure by which to review requests for newly\nFDA-approved drug products that require notification. This general criterion will apply only\nuntil drug-specific criteria can be developed and implemented for claims processing. Once\ndrug-specific criteria are available, and the authorization provided from this general criterion\nexpires, the subsequent coverage review will be completed using the Initial Authorization\nsection of the drug-specific criteria. UnitedHealthcare Pharmacy (UHCP) will designate the\nspecific medications which are subject to this criterion and inform the Pharmacy Benefits\nAdministrator (PBA). Oral oncology products will use the Oral Chemotherapeutic Agent Prior\nAuthorization Program criteria for review.\n2. Coverage Criteria:\nA. Guideline\n1. For recent FDA-approved drug products for which drug-specific criteria are unavailable,\nthe requested drug will be approved based on both of the following criteria:\na. Diagnosis is consistent with an indication listed in the product’s FDA-approved\nprescribing information (or package insert)\nb. Additional requirements listed in the “Indications and Usage” and “Dosage and\nAdministration” sections of the prescribing information (or package insert) have\nbeen met (e.g. first line therapies have been tried and failed; any testing\nrequirements have been met, etc.)\nAuthorization will be issued for 6 months and should allow a quantity ceiling limit up\nto the maximum FDA approved dose unless otherwise noted on tracking grid or unless\nthe FDA approved treatment duration is less than 6 months.\n• If FDA approved treatment duration is less than 6 m",
    "t up\nto the maximum FDA approved dose unless otherwise noted on tracking grid or unless\nthe FDA approved treatment duration is less than 6 months.\n• If FDA approved treatment duration is less than 6 months utilize the approved\nduration for authorization period.\n• Requests for higher quantity beyond the FDA approved maximum dosing are not\nseparately reviewable by the PA department.\n© 2024 UnitedHealthcare Services, Inc.\n1\n3. Additional Clinical Rules:\n• Notwithstanding Coverage Criteria, UnitedHealthcare may approve initial and re-authorization\nbased solely on previous claim/medication history, diagnosis codes (ICD-10) and/or claim logic.\nUse of automated approval and re-approval processes varies by program and/or therapeutic class.\n4.
