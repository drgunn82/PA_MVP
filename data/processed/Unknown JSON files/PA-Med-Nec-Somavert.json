Background:\nSomavert (pegvisomant) is a growth hormone receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment\nof acromegaly in patients who have had an inadequate response to surgery or radiation\ntherapy, or for whom these therapies are not appropriate. The goal of treatment is to\nnormalize serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels.1\nThe American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) recommends pegvisomant in\npatients for whom surgical treatment and somatostatin analogues (SSAs) have proved\nineffective or for those who are intolerant of SSAs.2 The AACE and the Endocrine Society\nalso recommend that dopamine agonists may be considered as first-line medical therapy,\nparticularly in patients with mild biochemical activity, such as in the setting of modestly\nelevated serum IGF-I levels in the absence or concomitant presence of SSA therapy.2,3\n2.
