Background:\nIsotretinoin is indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are\ninflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or more. “Severe,” by definition, means\n“many” as opposed to “few or several” nodules. Isotretinoin should be reserved for patients\nwith severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic\nantibiotics. Due to its teratogenicity, isotretinoin is not indicated in patients who are or may\nbecome pregnant.\nA single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and\nprolonged remission of disease in many patients. If a second course of therapy is needed, it\nis recommended to wait at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because\nexperience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off isotretinoin. The\noptimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not\ncompleted skeletal growth.\n2. Coverage Criteriaa:\nA. Initial Authorization\n1.
